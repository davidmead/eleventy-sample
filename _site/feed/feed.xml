		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Call it a very hard reset, but I wanted to build something new. From the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All previous content has now been deleted from this server. I really don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll add it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&#39;s under the hood?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get out of my technology comfort zone. Use something I&#39;m not familiar with. That&#39;s why I ended up using an SSG, or Static Site Generator in longhand. It builds everything locally, using Javascript (shudder), and you just FTP the flat files up to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sometimes, the old ways are the best.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ctmiller.net/&quot; title=&quot;Chris Miller&#39;s website&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; for hearing me out when I wondered how hard is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; to build a CMS from scratch. And thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bridgestew.com/&quot; title=&quot;Bridget&#39;s blog&quot;&gt;Bridget&lt;/a&gt; for guiding me through some potholes as she&#39;d built her site using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.io/&quot; title=&quot;official site&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot that may &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; work initially. I&#39;m also sure there&#39;s a lot better ways of doing some of the workflow and code. But it&#39;s in a state where I feel &amp;quot;confident&amp;quot; putting it up. Let&#39;s see what breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 years using Twitter, around 7 on Instagram, and I think I&#39;m pretty much done with it at the moment. I haven&#39;t logged in or posted to either in 4 months, so I could leave them inactive, but closing them is starting to feel like the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve already disconnected the apps &amp;amp; services to them. Also requested exports of my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may just just use &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidmead&quot; title=&quot;main twitter account&quot;&gt;@davidmead&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidjohnmead&quot; title=&quot;alternate twitter account&quot;&gt;@davidjohnmead&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter as an alternative RSS feed - Just post links to the latest posts here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indieweb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still a fan, and proponent, of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/&quot; title=&quot;own your content&quot;&gt;Indieweb&lt;/a&gt;. Just not sure how much of it I&#39;ll be adding/using here. See my previous statement about social media. I&#39;ve added some of the basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/&quot;&gt;microformats&lt;/a&gt; to my HTML templates, but that may be as far as it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll do a write up of getting started with Eleventy soon. Maybe try for a post a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. I&#39;m pushing this live. Hopefully the RSS feed is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Handling broken links</title>
		<link href="https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2019-12-04-handling-broken-links/"/>
		<updated>2019-12-03T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2019-12-04-handling-broken-links/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Deleting all of my existing content, and there was a lot, means I&#39;ve left a lot of broken links in my wake. With something like Wordpress or Known this is handled for you as a 404 error, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html&quot; title=&quot;W3C information page&quot;&gt;server error code for missing files&lt;/a&gt;, will bring up a pre-built 404 page. Not so when rolling your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.io/docs/quicktips/not-found/&quot; title=&quot;404 page for Eleventy&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; with steps to create one on the Eleventy site. Not too hard to implement, just means a little editing of my .htaccess file, and creating a new page to upload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should now be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I included an explanation of why the content someone was looking for may not be there, along with a link to the Wayback Machine which has snapshots of billions of web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 2nd 2019 I deleted all my content, and started fresh. If you&#39;re following a link from elsewhere you can try the Wayback Machine which may have a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also visit the home page to read anything new I&#39;ve posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that should be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2019-12-05-lighthouse-scores/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was one of the things I had my fingers crossed for when deciding to use a Static Site Generator for my site. As I&#39;m writing my own HTML and CSS from scratch I try and weave in all the best practices I&#39;ve learned over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigating to the homepage in the Chrome browser (incognito mode to make sure no extensions are effecting the results) I opened the Developer tools and clicked audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidjohnmead.com/img/lighthouse-results-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lighthouse audit results all green for new homepage&quot; title=&quot;Audit results all green&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homepage returned the following results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;98% Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% Accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% Best Practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% SEO (Search Engine Optimization)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too shabby for a first run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &#39;post&#39; pages faired pretty well too. Only difference was a 97% score for performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidjohnmead.com/img/lighthouse-results-post.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lighthouse audit results all green for post pages&quot; title=&quot;Audit results all green&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I know that you can get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/&quot; title=&quot;Manuel Matuzovic&#39;s post pointing out the dangers of automated testing&quot;&gt;Lighthouse to give a 100% for accessibility on a completely inaccessible site&lt;/a&gt;, but 100% is a great starting point to make changes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ding on performance, on both mobile and desktop tests, is from using Google Fonts. You&#39;ll get that regardless, and I personally think just using two is fairly restrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be sure I had ran the templates through an HTML validator, and the only thing that it reported was &lt;code&gt;rel=&amp;quot;microsub&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. I&#39;m sure as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/#endpoint-discovery&quot; title=&quot;End point discovery in the spec&quot;&gt;microsub is a W3C spec&lt;/a&gt; this will be corrected soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be keeping an eye on all of this, but not slavishly.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Ambient music from an American painter</title>
		<link href="https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2019-12-06-listen-empty-city/"/>
		<updated>2019-12-05T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2019-12-06-listen-empty-city/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t remember when I first heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://torlundvall.com/&quot; title=&quot;official site&quot;&gt;Tor Lundvall&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s work, but I&#39;ve now got 3 of his albums I tend to play back-to-back. Out of the 3, &lt;a href=&quot;https://torlundvall.bandcamp.com/album/empty-city&quot; title=&quot;Buy it on Bandcamp&quot;&gt;Empty City&lt;/a&gt; is my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the night trips, I&#39;d stare out the window at abandoned factories, empty warehouses and other structures bathed in the dull orange or greenish glow of streetlights. I wanted to crawl into that hidden world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Tor Lundvall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the kind of ambient music that mixes big spaces with intimate voices to create a definite mood. And it&#39;s equally great played in any season. It changes slightly if listening in Winter or Summer, but fits both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of his later albums have a mix of instrumental and lyrical tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Code cleanup and the emergency room</title>
		<link href="https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2019-12-08-code-and-er/"/>
		<updated>2019-12-07T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2019-12-08-code-and-er/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had an idea of the look and layout I wanted for this blog, but I didn&#39;t do a mock in Sketch or anything. I wanted to &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; it while I was marking up the templates. It came together pretty quick. I changed the fonts a couple of times but that was about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after I launched it I saw there was quite a bit I could clean up. Yeah it validated and was semantic, but there was a few things I could do better with CSS Grid..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back through my notes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://rachelandrew.co.uk/&quot; title=&quot;official site&quot;&gt;Rachel Andrews&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s workshop at &lt;a href=&quot;https://rustbeltrefresh.com/&quot; title=&quot;Web conference in Cleveland&quot;&gt;Rustbelt Refresh&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a couple of videos from &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/FEnRpy9Xfes&quot; title=&quot;Layout Land video on YouTube&quot;&gt;Jen Simmons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/KOvGeFUHAC0&quot; title=&quot;Mozilla Dev video on YouTube&quot;&gt;Miriam Suzanne&lt;/a&gt;, I quickly dumped a lot of classes and employed grid in 3 of the Eleventy templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Base template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main HTML template now uses grid for its structure. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; are set as rows. With the footer always being at the bottom of the page with just four lines of CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;display:grid;
grid-gap: 1em;
grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
min-height: 100vh;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of different templates at the moment, for different types of content. One for mini album reviews, one for photos, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these few lines of CSS I can get 2 columns laid out for the &#39;listen&#39; type, within the grid that wraps the whole page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 240px 1fr;
grid-gap: 1.5em;
grid-auto-rows: minmax(auto, auto);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emergency room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidjohnmead.com/img/2019-12-08-jjm-er.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Josh in a triage room&quot; title=&quot;Josh in a triage room&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through writing this Josh came home with Julie. He had been complaining about a pain in his back in the morning. It hadn&#39;t got better with an Advil. Seeing as the local Urgent Care isn&#39;t open on Sunday, it was a trip to the ER as he was in pain walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain pills, muscle relaxant injection, and an icy-hot patch later, he feels a little better and has a note to excuse hime from gym this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that&#39;s all the excitement for the week out the way.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a &#39;Main Street&#39; at my work. The centre place on our ground floor. This year it contains this great piece.
&lt;p&gt;We have art all around the HQ (not surprising with one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cleveland.com/arts/2019/12/dealer-tire-ceo-scott-mueller-leads-by-example-as-new-chairman-of-cleveland-museum-of-art.html&quot; title=&quot;newspaper article&quot;&gt;our owners&lt;/a&gt; is Chairman of Cleveland Museum of Art) and having something like this beats the normal corporate Xmas trees you see at a lot of places.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Problem with Eleventy, RSS, and images</title>
		<link href="https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2019-12-11-problem-with-rss-and-images/"/>
		<updated>2019-12-10T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2019-12-11-problem-with-rss-and-images/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that in the RSS feed of this site, images within posts only show up some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the generated source code, they are all within the main block of the content being displayed in the item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick duck-duck-go-ing and I came across a couple of general RSS issues along the same lines. Some was where the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; was being ignored as it wasn&#39;t in a containing element. Easy fix I thought. I made sure all the images were in a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, as the ones showing up in the feed were part of the written post (in the middle of content) as opposed to a specific &amp;quot;photo post&amp;quot; which was just the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t make any difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here comes CDATA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I noticed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2019-12-11/1576080408129100&quot;&gt;conversation on the indieweb chat&lt;/a&gt; about images and RSS. Wrapping things between &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;]]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; was a recommendation. I checked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://granary.io/&quot; title=&quot;The social web translator&quot;&gt;Granary.io&lt;/a&gt;. After plugging a URL of one of my posts in that, the output did have those CDATA tags around it. So I added those into my &lt;code&gt;feed.njk&lt;/code&gt; file. No luck. In fact it made the HTML be written out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then re-read through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/&quot;&gt;Eleventy post about adding RSS&lt;/a&gt; a couple of times. Everything in my code matched, but something nagged at me about the &lt;code&gt;htmlToAbsoluteUrls&lt;/code&gt; part. What if the URL for the image wasn&#39;t there when the page is being built?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Photo post template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a specific template for photo posts. I use this in the front matter...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;layout: layouts/layout-photo
imgSRC: /img/
imgALT:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...to pull in the photo so I can style it. So if it&#39;s not in the actual content until the flat HTML is &amp;quot;built&amp;quot; the feed file won&#39;t pull it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is an issue with all static site generators.&lt;/p&gt;
