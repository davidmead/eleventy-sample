			<p>I remember attending the  SXSWi 2011 panel <a href="https://austin2011.sched.com/event/2Y3q/banks-innovate-or-die" title="Panel overview on SCHED.com">Banks! Innovate or die</a> and being impressed by the lively discussion. Especially Joshua Reich, the CEO of Simple at that point.</p>
<p><a href="https://simple.com">Simple</a> had been going for a couple of years at that point, but seeing Joshua made me want to have them as my bank. Two things stand out from <a href="https://davidmead-sxswi11.tumblr.com/post/3808589222/session-2" title="post on Tumblr">my notes</a> on that panel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Josh's <q>Bankers are poor at dealing with people</q> statement was, and is, so true</li>
<li>Like it or not, banks are now too big and can/will absorb these other types.  Not to the say they can't learn something</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, a decade later, <a href="https://www.simple.com/blog/simple-is-closing">Simple is closing</a>. It was sold to BBVA USA, they in turn are being bought by PNC Bank. The Verge has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219271/simple-bank-online-shutting-down-pnc-bbva" title="The Verge article">good round-up</a> on the history and announcement.</p>
<p>My experience with Simple has been nothing but <strong>excellent</strong>. The rare times I had to call I always spoke to someone directly who helped. Never had to call multiple times. The website and app were great and have influenced a lot of the changes traditional banks have made with their offerings.</p>
<p>I will miss the clarity in their email, messaging, and UI. I'll miss seeing exactly what is 'Safe-to-Spend' and having 'Goals' to squirrel away small amounts to pay for a specific thing later on. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/i2pi/status/1347266937932316673">tweet</a> Joshua said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our first mission statement was to help people worry less about money. It morphed to ‘help people feel confidence’. Either way, we wanted to help people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel they achieved this in my eyes.</p>
<p>Reddit users have now started a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Etr8dGtviSRpdAjREgBErc47SlqMVjwZDJjHKxX7eOk/edit#gid=0">Google Sheet to compare features</a> from Simple to other banks, helping people to choose an alternative. It's clear there are very few that can compare.</p>
