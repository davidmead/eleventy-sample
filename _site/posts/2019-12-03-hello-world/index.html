		<p class="p-summary txt-center">The TL;DR is I deleted all my content and built a new blog.</p>
		<div class="e-content">
			<p>Call it a very hard reset, but I wanted to build something new. From the ground up.</p>
<p>All previous content has now been deleted from this server. I really don't know if I'll add it back.</p>
<h2>What's under the hood?</h2>
<p>I wanted to get out of my technology comfort zone. Use something I'm not familiar with. That's why I ended up using an SSG, or Static Site Generator in longhand. It builds everything locally, using Javascript (shudder), and you just FTP the flat files up to the server.</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes, the old ways are the best.&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://ctmiller.net/" title="Chris Miller's website">Chris</a> for hearing me out when I wondered how hard is it <em>really</em> to build a CMS from scratch. And thanks to <a href="https://www.bridgestew.com/" title="Bridget's blog">Bridget</a> for guiding me through some potholes as she'd built her site using <a href="https://www.11ty.io/" title="official site">Eleventy</a> too.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a lot that may <strong>not</strong> work initially. I'm also sure there's a lot better ways of doing some of the workflow and code. But it's in a state where I feel &quot;confident&quot; putting it up. Let's see what breaks.</p>
<h2>Social Media</h2>
<p>12 years using Twitter, around 7 on Instagram, and I think I'm pretty much done with it at the moment. I haven't logged in or posted to either in 4 months, so I could leave them inactive, but closing them is starting to feel like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I've already disconnected the apps &amp; services to them. Also requested exports of my data.</p>
<p>I may just just use <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmead" title="main twitter account">@davidmead</a> and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/davidjohnmead" title="alternate twitter account">@davidjohnmead</a> on Twitter as an alternative RSS feed - Just post links to the latest posts here.</p>
<h2>Indieweb</h2>
<p>I'm still a fan, and proponent, of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/" title="own your content">Indieweb</a>. Just not sure how much of it I'll be adding/using here. See my previous statement about social media. I've added some of the basic <a href="http://microformats.org">microformats</a> to my HTML templates, but that may be as far as it goes.</p>
<h2>Going Forward</h2>
<p>I'll do a write up of getting started with Eleventy soon. Maybe try for a post a day.</p>
<p>OK. I'm pushing this live. Hopefully the RSS feed is working.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>
