		<div class="e-content">
			<p>I've been an ardent fan of Google products from the get-go. Â I've always preferred their mobile OS over Apples, owning both Nexus and Pixel phones throughout the years.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Tablets/Nexus_7/">Nexus 7 tablet</a> was, hands-down, the device I enjoyed using most out of everything I've used.</p>
<p>Gmail and its suite of software just works. YouTube and Google Play Music were fun.</p>
<p>Launching games on Xbox, watching video (Chromecast), or playing my music library through the Google Home Mini, by talking - Fantastic!</p>
<p>I wanted a <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home_max_speaker">Google Home Max</a>, and was getting very excited to see the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-confirmed-a-new-nest-smart-speaker-is-coming-heres-what-we-know/">new version</a> launching soon, but no more.</p>
<h2>Disappointments</h2>
<p>When my Nexus 7 died, they was no new line to replace it. Google left the tablet market.</p>
<p>The Pixel 2 phone lost the wireless charging I loved in the Nexus line.</p>
<p>Task app doesn't do half of what most other apps (Wunderlist, Remember the milk) did, making it worthless.</p>
<p>Gmail hasn't seen any love in ages. YouTube is now an advertising platform, and Google Play Music had a stake driven through its heart in the form of YouTube Music.</p>
<p>With that, I recently transferred my music collection over to YTM only to find I can't play it through my Google Home Mini unless I buy a subscription!</p>

<p>What incentive do I have to purchase a $300+ max speaker from them now?</p>
<h2>Your old and cheap</h2>
<p>Wont' argue there. Yes, I am older. Yes, I don't like paying for things I don't have to. But here's the thing - I happily pay for quite a lot of things that've replaced Google's &quot;FREE&quot; services, because they are better.</p>
<p><a href="https://hey.com">Hey</a> is the new email service from Basecamp. I pay for it.</p>
<p>1password, Pocket Cast, Flickr, and Instapaper are services/apps bought rather than using the free alternative.</p>
<p>99% of my music is purchased either digitally, or ripped from CDs I bought ages ago. I don't use streaming services, so paying to bury my music collection in one with a load of ads doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>The thought of the verbal gymnastics I'd have to use to get anything played from 'my library' in YouTube Music is a non-starter.</p>
<p>Also paying an extra monthly fee for the ability to stream music I own, to a device I own, via a WiFi connection I own is ludicrous.</p>
