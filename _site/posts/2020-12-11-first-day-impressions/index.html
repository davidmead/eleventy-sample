		<div class="e-content">
			<p>After a full day of playing I can honestly say <strong>I'm really enjoying this game</strong>. There's a lot here, but it's not all <a href="#good">good</a>. There's a lot of <a href="#bad">bad</a> too.</p>
<h2 id="good">The good</h2>
The story has pulled me in. Reminding me a lot of the original role-plying game. There's a lot of name drops I remember from the lore books too. They have captured the look and feel wonderfully well. A mix of that synth-wave retro future of "jacking in to the net".
<p>The world feels huge. Just looking around as an NPC drives you from a-to-b lets you drink it all in. The freedom of movement to go, and do, pretty much anything is fantastic.</p>
<p>Messages, phones calls, and emails continually come in regardless of what you're engaged in. The city feels populated and lived in.</p>
<p>Trying to hack an air conditioner, so you can disable cameras, in the middle of a firefight is nerve-wracking.</p>
<p>I collect everything but have yet to truly grasp what to hold onto, sell, or deconstruct.</p>
<p>The skill tree is massive and really brings back memories of second-guessing if your spending XP in the right place to improve your character.</p>
<h2 id="bad">The bad</h2>
<p>The graphics! Oh my. They are <em>not</em> good.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2020-12-11-screenshot-cyberpunk2077-diner.png" alt="screenshot showing Johnny Silverhand in a diner"></p>
<p>This game has been in development for about 8 years. It was targeted at the current generation of consoles. It was announced at E3 2018 (primarily an Xbox event). And yet the graphics look blurry and &quot;muddy&quot;. Textures fail to render. Details are completely lost when you walk up close to signs and interfaces.</p>
<p>Some of the visual settings you can turn off, like film grain, makes this a little better but not much.</p>
<p>Destiny 2 and The Division 2 have been out a couple of years now and have a lot better graphics than this. Cyberpunk looks like an upscaled port from an older system sometimes.</p>
<p>I have also experienced three full crashes taking me back to the Xbox dashboard. Thankfully the saves points have been where I didn't have to replay too much.</p>
<p>Objects seem to get left in your way. I couldn't exit a room to proceed because a suitcase we carried in, appeared in the middle of the door blocking me.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2020-12-11-screenshot-cyberpunk2077-suitcase.png" alt="screenshot showing suitcase blocking door"></p>
<p>I really hope there are some upcoming patches that improve these issues.</p>
<h2>Am I happy I bought it?</h2>
Yes. 100%.
<p>Should you get it? Well, if you haven't already I would wait. Especially on a console.</p>
