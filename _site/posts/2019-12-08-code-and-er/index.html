		<p class="p-summary"><i class="la la-pen-nib"></i> Tidied up some Eleventy templates, CSS, and took a trip to the ER</p>
		<div class="e-content">
			<p>I had an idea of the look and layout I wanted for this blog, but I didn't do a mock in Sketch or anything. I wanted to &quot;find&quot; it while I was marking up the templates. It came together pretty quick. I changed the fonts a couple of times but that was about it.</p>
<p>But after I launched it I saw there was quite a bit I could clean up. Yeah it validated and was semantic, but there was a few things I could do better with CSS Grid..</p>
<p>Looking back through my notes from <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/" title="official site">Rachel Andrews</a>'s workshop at <a href="https://rustbeltrefresh.com/" title="Web conference in Cleveland">Rustbelt Refresh</a>, as well as a couple of videos from <a href="https://youtu.be/FEnRpy9Xfes" title="Layout Land video on YouTube">Jen Simmons</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/KOvGeFUHAC0" title="Mozilla Dev video on YouTube">Miriam Suzanne</a>, I quickly dumped a lot of classes and employed grid in 3 of the Eleventy templates.</p>
<h2>Base template</h2>
<p>My main HTML template now uses grid for its structure. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> are set as rows. With the footer always being at the bottom of the page with just four lines of CSS.</p>
<pre><code>display:grid;
grid-gap: 1em;
grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
min-height: 100vh;
</code></pre>
<h2>Content templates</h2>
<p>I have a couple of different templates at the moment, for different types of content. One for mini album reviews, one for photos, etc.</p>
<p>With these few lines of CSS I can get 2 columns laid out for the 'listen' type, within the grid that wraps the whole page.</p>
<pre><code>display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 240px 1fr;
grid-gap: 1.5em;
grid-auto-rows: minmax(auto, auto);
</code></pre>
<h2>Emergency room</h2>
<p><img src="/img/2019-12-08-jjm-er.jpg" alt="Josh in a triage room" title="Josh in a triage room"></p>
<p>Halfway through writing this Josh came home with Julie. He had been complaining about a pain in his back in the morning. It hadn't got better with an Advil. Seeing as the local Urgent Care isn't open on Sunday, it was a trip to the ER as he was in pain walking around.</p>
<p>Pain pills, muscle relaxant injection, and an icy-hot patch later, he feels a little better and has a note to excuse hime from gym this week.</p>
<p>Hopefully that's all the excitement for the week out the way.</p>
