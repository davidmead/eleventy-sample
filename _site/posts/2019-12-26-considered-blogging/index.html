		<p class="p-summary txt-center">Long post about not having comments, or sharing on &quot;social media&quot;.</p>
		<div class="e-content">
			<p>Part of my decision to blow my previous blog/site away and start afresh was technology based. <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> was becoming too convoluted. <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a> (while a lot better) still has too much developer tinkering to get it where I wanted.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> and the Static Site Generator choice. It still has its learning curve and frustrations, but they stay on my laptop. Everything I publish to the web is a flat HTML file, which is nice.</p>
<h2>But what else?</h2>
<p>The other part of my decision was borne from the current state of world online. The megalithic silos of Facebook, Twitter, and Google  <em>are</em> the web for a large part of those online in The West. And you can see why people stay in those silos to get news and opinions.</p>
<p>Paywall reminders, newsletter subscription popups, embedded advertising, and (shudder) “content recommendation” advertising.  This seems to be the make up of most sites outside the silos.</p>
<p>Both options are also riddled with tracking cookies. Harvesting interactions &amp; attention to sell, or leak, to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>So was it a &quot;tin foil hat&quot; decision? No. I've made my peace with the trade-off of privacy and access long ago.</p>
<p>It's more about putting consideration over impulse.</p>
<h2>Impulse</h2>
<p>I'm sure there are studies on how the increase in information retrieval speed, has effected us.</p>
<p>A month long pilgrimage to the &quot;local&quot; monastery vs. millisecond glances at the always on pocket computer <strong>must</strong> have some impact.</p>
<p>Pair that with the ability for almost anyone to contribute and <em>change</em> that information, rather than the monks-Huge!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>im·pulse
/ˈimˌpəls/
a sudden strong and unreflective urge or desire to act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But with that access and speed has come the proliferation of the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_take" title="Wikipedia entry">hot take</a>&quot;, the &quot;well actually&quot;, &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling" title="Wikipedia entry">virtue signalling</a>&quot;, and the business models that feed off of (and in to) this.  The dopamine + financial reward of &quot;likes&quot; for impulsiveness is rampant.</p>
<p>This is very recent, even in the silo's history. Early Twitter had stars that, for me at least, doubled as a way to bookmark shared links/tweets. That went out as the potential business models became clear.</p>
<h2>Consideration</h2>
<p>This year I logged out of Twitter and Instagram (deleting my Facebook account some time ago) and didn't miss them.</p>
<p>Unsubscribed from certain RSS feeds, YouTube channels, and podcasts. Reduced the amount of stuff I consume.</p>
<p>I also didn't post anything to my site. But I wanted to.</p>
<p>A few words kept floating around me; mindful, thoughtful, measured. But one stuck more than most.</p>
<p>Considered. I wanted consideration to play a part of what I put out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>con·sid·er·a·tion
/kənˌsidərˈāSH(ə)n/
careful thought, typically over a period of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what made the choice of a static site generator the right one.</p>
<p>Removing the easy instant access to post anything forces me to consider what I'm putting out.</p>
<p>I still jot down notes, take photos, bookmark links. But the act of waiting until I get home to generate the file and FTP it to the web is...refreshing.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. This doesn't make what I post any better per se, but it does make me think more before I do.</p>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>This site is for me. My, considered, thoughts. I put them on the web for any crawler, RSS reader, or browser to look at. For anyone to consume and share.</p>
<p>I'm currently not interested in who/what comes and looks, how many times it happens, or if it happens at all. I have implemented zero analytics on this site.</p>
<p>At this point-in-time I am also not concerned with sharing them into the silos. Or what others think of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy/status/1210253110599241728" title="tweet">Amy Hoy</a> summed up how I feel...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i extremely do not care about who faved 2 of my tweets! that’s the equivalent of a notification popping up that “this random person in the convenience store glanced at your sneakers”</p>
