			<div><p>Until the beginning of 2021 I had no recollection of knowing about Mark Fisher, or his writing.  Being name-dropped in a few unrelated recent videos and podcasts, and having a connection to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauntology" title="wikipedia entry">hauntology</a> tickled something in my brain.</p>
<p>I watched his talk, <a href="https://youtu.be/aCgkLICTskQ" title="video on YouTube">The Slow Cancellation of the Future</a>, and it struck such a nerve with me I grabbed his book '<a href="https://www.johnhuntpublishing.com/zer0-books/our-books/ghosts-my-life">Ghosts of My Life: Writings on Depression, Hauntology and Lost Futures</a>'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not only has the future not arrived, it no longer seems possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a collection of Mark's writing (articles, reviews, etc.) on his blog or other publications. Out-of-the-gate he starts with Sapphire and Steel episodes, mentioned in his talk. How this odd series (even back then) resonates even more the further we move away from it.</p>
<p>This is the first book I've read on the Kindle where I highlighted passages and made notes. So much in Mark's writing touched on ideas/feelings I had when consuming the same media.</p>
<p>Ever been in pub or bar (remember them?) and a friend-of-a-friend would sit at your table and you suddenly found a kindred spirit? They liked the same things you did, but had a slightly different take on them. Reading this book was like Mark had sat down at my table in the <a href="http://www.closedpubs.co.uk/essex/southend_corkcheese.html" title="local pub, now closed">Cork &amp; Cheese</a> and Friday night just whizzed by.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>those who can’t remember the past are condemned to have it resold to them forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though this book came out in 2014, and <a href="https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/obituaries/mark-fisher-obituary-thrillingly-creative-critic" title="obituary on BFI">Mark died in 2017</a>, I found myself comparing a lot of what he wrote to events from 2020. The pandemic, lockdowns, the virulent spread of disinformation via social media.</p>
<p>This quote nagged at me...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The postcolonial melancholic doesn’t (just) refuse to accept change; at some level, he refuses to accept that change has happened at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...that maybe this is what Trump followers were feeling. MAGA cope of the big lie?</p>
<p>I hadn't seen or heard some of the things in the reviews but have jotted them down for later. I may go and revisit some of the albums from Burial, John Foxx, and Tricky that he writes about. See if I agree with his take on these.  I don't know if I will, but that's ok.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The album is like the faded ten year-old tag of a kid whose Rave dreams have been crushed by a series of dead end jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've a list of other books of his work waiting for me to consume this year, and thoughts of the futures now lost without his coverage.</p>
