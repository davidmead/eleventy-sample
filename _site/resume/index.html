		<h1>Resume of David Mead</h1>
		<p>Information Architect & User Experience Designer</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Over 20 years of experience in the design & development of web sites, Intranets, advertising projects, and apps. I have worked with large corporations and small companies, both as clients and employers.</p>

<p>I am self-motivated with excellent communication skills and have a passion for web standards and exploring the next generation of user experiences on the web. I create user-centered designs, based on feedback, interviews, analytics and user testing. I can hand code my own, semantic, fully-functioning HTML mocks as well as creating them in programs such as Sketch/InVision.</p>

<p>Keeping up with the latest thinking and methodologies has enabled me to deliver great results for every project I've been involved with.</p>
