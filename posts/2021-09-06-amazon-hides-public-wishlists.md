I personally don't use Amazon that much. Julie has a Prime account, so if I want something I email a link to her and she orders it.

It has been handy buying presents for family back in the UK, so I do use the .co.uk site sometimes. For Mum's birthday my sister added some puzzles she wants to her public wishlist. Problem is, we couldn't find it. Several text threads later we figure out why.

Turns out Amazon made a change where public wishlists are <strong>no longer public</strong>. The old way of [searching by email address](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/find-someones-amazon-wish-list-by-his-or-her-e-mail-address/ "2012 CNET article") has been replaced. You now have to request, by email, they share the public list with you.

I guess this changed a few years back, but if you don't use it regularly having it disappear is frustrating to say the least.
