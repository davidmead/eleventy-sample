Since Google Music was killed about the only thing I use a voice command for (on my Google Home Mini) is playing [SomaFM](https://somafm.com "listener supported online radio"). But even that is now becoming a pain.

## When I say...
<q>Hey Google, play SomaFM Groove Salad</q> is something I say quite often. Drone Zone or SF-1033 are two of the other main stations I listen to.

I know Google Assistant understands what I'm saying because it repeats it back to me. I can also see it in the [Voice & Audio Activity page](https://history.google.com/history/audio " ") (see screenshot).

What I get is <q>Sure, check out this SomaFM - groove salad station on YouTube Music.</q> <strong>No</strong>. That's not what I want.

And this isn't every time. Just occasionally.

## Back to button pushing
I've written before how [Google is losing me](/posts/2020-08-05-google-losing-me/ "post from 2020") and now, it seems, one of the last things is starting to fail.

I can't tell if this is a result of [Google not working with TuneIn properly](https://piunikaweb.com/2021/06/15/tunein-not-working-on-google-home/ "article on Piunikaweb") (it doesn't go straight to SomaFM for some reason) or a more a deliberate ploy to accept using YouTube music as a source. My old cynical brain goes with the latter.

I think it's time to break with voice commands and get an "old-fashioned" bluetooth speaker. Just browse to the website and cast the stream to it direct.
