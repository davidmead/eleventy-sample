This hit me harder than I thought.  Maybe because it's close to my own mums death this year. I dunno.

Elizabeth is the only Queen I knew. She was 96, ruled for over 70 years.  When we cleared the house in the UK, we found commemorative books of the Coronation, Jubilee's, etc.  And while I wouldn't consider myself the most ardent of royalists, I'm in no way an abolitionist.

Knowing The Queen was there always gave me a sense of calm, strength, and order.  Governments came & went, but the hierarchy remained.  Maybe that's akin to what religious people feel.  That subconscious fall back of someone "at the wheel".

Today Prince Charles was proclaimed King Charles III.
