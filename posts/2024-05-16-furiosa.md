Today I took Josh to see <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga/" title="Letterboxd entry">Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</a>.

Though not as full-on as Fury Road, this still had some really great action set-pieces.  Where it shines is the world-building. Giving not only a backstory for Furiosa, but also the shaping of The Wastelands where both films take place.

Chris Hemsworth turns it up to 11 as Dementusâ€”The main (but not only) villain of the film. And Anya Taylor-Joy conveys so much of her revenge-driven pursuit of him with barely any dialogue.  It's all in the eyes.

It's great that George Miller is still writing & directing this set of stories. Fingers crossed for a third installment with Tom Hardy returning as Max.
