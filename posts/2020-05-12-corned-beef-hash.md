Corned beef hash is my "go-to" when visiting a diner for breakfast. Growing up in 70's England I ate my fair share of the tinned variety.

So now I have a simple recipe to make my own with tinned corned beef (foodie snobs be damned).

<section class="h-recipe">
<h2>Corned Beef Hash Recipe</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
What I generally use is:

<ul>
<li class="p-ingredient">medium size potatoes	   </li>
<li class="p-ingredient">half of a onion		   </li>
<li class="p-ingredient">can of corned beef	   </li>
<li class="p-ingredient">tablespoon butter	   </li>
<li class="p-ingredient">cooking oil			   </li>
<li class="p-ingredient">salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<p>Takes <time class="dt-duration" datetime="30M">30 minutes</time>, serves <data class="p-yield" value="4">four people</data>.</p>

<div class="e-instructions">
<h3>Directions</h3>
Here's I how make it (mostly)
<ol>
<li>Fill a medium saucepan with water, add salt											   </li>
<li>Peel and quarter the potatoes, then add to the saucepan								   </li>
<li>Simmer for about 15 minutes so they're just undercooked								   </li>
<li>Finely dice the onion																   </li>
<li>Cube the corned beef																   </li>
<li>While the potatoes are simmering, warm up cast iron skillet or pan over medium/low heat</li>
<li>Drain the potatoes and cube															   </li>
<li>Add potatoes and corned beef to the pan												   </li>
<li>Add a little oil and the butter to the skillet to melt								   </li>
<li>Add onions, potatoes, and corned beef												   </li>
<li>Pat down to an even layer and cook until crispy									   </li>
<li>Slowly flip and cook until the other side is crispy								   </li>
</ol>
</div>

Now you can just serve with some eggs, or on it's own. Keeps well in the fridge for the next day. Josh &amp; I normally have it for dinner and there's enough for breakfast.
