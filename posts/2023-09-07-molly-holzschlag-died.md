I heard <a href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/090523_molly_holzschlag/tucsons-molly-holzschlag-known-as-the-fairy-godmother-web-dead-60/" title="Obituary from Tucson Sentinel">Molly Holzschlag died</a> yesterday. Quite a few of the "old guard"; <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/09/06/memories-of-molly/" title="Eric Meyer's blog">Eric</a>, <a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/2023/goodbye-molly-holzschlag/" title="Bruce Lawson's blog">Bruce</a>, and <a href="https://www.lireo.com/remembering-molly-holzschlag/" title="">Deborah</a>, posted their memories and stories about her.

I was lucky to have met Molly a couple of times, the first at SxSW back in 2007.  She was a friendly force of good for the web. I enjoyed her writing advocating for Web Standards, and admired her will in the face of great adversity in her later life.

My last memory of her is receiving an envelope of original Technorati stickers in the mail that she'd sent. That must've been about 5 years ago.

Thanks for all the hard work, and taking time to say hello. You'll be missed.
