2 weeks ago I had a pain in my left foot.  It felt a little like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plantar-fasciitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354846" title="Mayo Clinic page">Plantar fasciitis</a>, which I've experienced before. So I started with some stretches and ice. See if I could get ahead of it.

The pain got worse. I noticed my foot was swollen when I removed my socks & shoes.  It got so bad I could only wear Josh's old Crocks, and was hobbling around.

Then I started losing sleep. Blankets touching my foot was painful. Stretching or touching it was painful.  I took Tylenol (no effect), then switched to Advil, which did make a difference.

Friends and family started suggesting it <em>could</em> be <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gout/symptoms-causes/syc-20372897" title="Mayo Clinic page">Gout</a>. Ridiculous. That's for old Dickensian characters, swigging Port and eating Roast Beef all day.

Off to the doctors and, 3 attempts at drawing blood later (it <strong>never</strong> goes well), I picked up a a prescription for Indomethacin.

This reduced the pain and the swelling.  Labs came back and yes, Gout confirmed.  So a different prescription, this time for Colchicine.

Stop one, start the other.

The pain is gone and I can start wearing shoes & socks again.  But now another drug, Allopurinol.  This is to help keep the levels of Uric Acid down which caused the Gout flare-up.  But I shouldn't be taken with the Triamterene-Hydrochlorothiazid I use for my high blood pressure.

Ye Gods!

So I have to buy a blood pressure monitoring device so I can check at home.

Growing old sucks.
