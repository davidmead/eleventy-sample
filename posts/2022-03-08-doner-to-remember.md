I'm sure this picture doesn't make it look <em>that</em> appealing to some, but to me this was <strong>delicious</strong>.

The taste hadn't changedâ€”A sense memory fast-pass back to Southend in the 90's.

Lamb doner meat, salad (shredded cabbage, lettuce, onions), and chilli sauce. All wrapped in warm pita bread.

Though you can get a version of this in the US, called Gyros, they pale in comparison.
