This weekend I got the chance to catch up with episodes of <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT0fv21DRJaU4PzC5EvE-rBHDgq_vS4U0" title="playlist on YouTube">You Gotta Hear This!</a> A series of conversations between <a href="https://www.austinwintory.com" title="Official website">Austin Wintory</a> (Composer) and <a href="https://twitter.com/TroyBakerVA" title="Twitter account">Troy Baker</a> (Actor).

Austin describes it as...

<figure class="blockquote">
	<blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/Bfcsugqh6mg">
		<p>A new podcast series with Troy Baker called "You Gotta Hear this!" I have listened to thousands of works in my life that it seems criminal for not everyone to have heard, so I'm mending that one piece at a time and getting Troy's reaction. Tangents, as per norm, to be expected!</p>
	</blockquote>

Now. I can't find this anywhere but on Austin's YouTube channel, so I wouldn't call it a podcast.

Austin is so enthusiastic about sharing the music & stories, and Troy is so eager to expand his knowledge in this area, it makes for a great time listening to them.

There are 16 videos, all around an hour or so long. Thoroughly recommend trying these if you have even a passing interest in music.
