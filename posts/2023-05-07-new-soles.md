In 2016 I dropped off some clothes at Goodwill.  I was in the market for some replacement shoes so I thought I'd look here.  Lo-and-behold I found a brown pair (that fit) for about $30.

Slightly worn and made by a brand I'd never heard of, <a href="https://www.mephisto.com/us/" title="US website for shoes">Mephisto</a>. After a quick clean they became my go-to pair.

Last year I noticed they had worn down considerably, so I looked to get a new pair. It was then that I discovered 1) Mephisto shoes are in the over $300 range and 2) they offered a <a href="https://www.mephistoresole.com" title="mephisto shoe & sandal refurbishment">refurbishment service</a> for about $160.

After a slight delay, due to parts coming from France, I received my (virtually) new shoes complete with cedar blocks, new laces, and fully polished.

Here's to another 6 years of wear.
