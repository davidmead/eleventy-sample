Cooked breakfasts are a treat for me.  They've always been a weekend, or holiday/work trip, treat. Number One, and <strong>the king</strong>, is the [Full English](https://flic.kr/p/hw6dG9 "photo on Flickr"). Coming in second is my US go-to, [Corned Beef with poached eggs](https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2015-09-12-foodspotting/ ""). Chilaquiles is now my third favourite.

For the sauce I followed [Ethan Chlebowski's recipe](https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/chilaquiles-the-mexican-breakfast-everyone-should-know-how-to-make "Blog post"). It's easy to make and keeps well in the fridge. Perfect for the weekend, or a <abbr title="work from home">WFH</abbr> morning if I don't oversleep.
