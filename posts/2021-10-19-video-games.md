I've been diving into some different games recently. Splitting my time between some new titles, and old favourites.

## Sable
I've been waiting on this for some time, and it doesn't disappoint. [Sable](https://www.shed-works.co.uk/sable "official site") lets you guide the titular character through a rites of passage that takes place in a world, very much like the drawings of [Moebius](https://www.moebius.fr "French artist").

So far it's a gentle ride. No combat, or death from falling. A lovely soundtrack, and immersive world that promotes exploration. I haven't finished it, just taking my time.

## Destiny 2
We bought the original Destiny for the Xbox 360, but Destiny 2 didn't grab us. That being said, as the game has progressed I've been enjoying it more & more now it's on Game Pass. So much so that I bought the latest Season Pass and have been really enjoying it.

A ton of lore, multiple storylines, and an all round good "looter shooter". I think I'll be buying the [Witch Queen expansion](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/WitchQueen "") when it comes out next year.

## The Division 2
Oh dear. We've had our issues haven't we.

After I posted [what I wanted in Division 3](/posts/2021-01-05-wishlist-part-1-for-the-division/ "") Ubisoft [announced](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/ "Ubisoft blog post") that the game was supposed to end with the current season (SPOILERS-<strong>No players</strong> guessed that at all), but there would be new content coming due to the continued community support (and being asked point blank during an earnings call).

        <p>Some of you had noticed that Title Update 12 was originally meant to be the last major Title Update for The Division 2...</p>

What's followed, since February, has been pretty much radio silence. They've re-run last years content. We had a whole series of bugs, our main characters disappear from the loading screen (see screenshot) after a patch, and virtually all the existing development team either leave or transfer to new projects.

Here's hoping they pull it together because I really enjoy this game, but it's getting harder to find a reason to play.

## Spiritfarer
This got an update with a new character. Still delightful. Still hitting me in the feels.

## The Long Dark
And Part 4 of the story mode, [Fury, then Silence](https://www.thelongdark.com/news/episode-four-launch/ "official site"), has now been released. I've held ff from playing Part 3 until this was out. So now I have a big chunk of content to play through, which I'm looking forward to.
