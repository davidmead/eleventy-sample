I have some great memories of attending, and volunteering at, the <a href="https://uxpacleveland.org/" title="">Experience Professionals Association</a> (UXPA) over the years.

I attended a couple of NEOUPA (Northeast Ohio chapter of the International Usability Professionals' Association.) meetings before it became the UXPA.

Then, when I joined Progressive Insurance, I volunteered in setting up and running them as it was the de-facto venue for a number of years. Even after leaving Progressive I was an on/off paid member.

So I was saddened to see this statement about it closing.

		<p>It is with a heavy heart that we announce that after 19 years, UXPA Cleveland is shutting down. We've experienced a decline in membership numbers and engagement (predating COVID, but worsened by it); difficulty finding volunteers to serve on the board; and increasing competition from the many other online events that exist today.</p>

They have made all their presentations and recordings available at <a href="https://uxpacleveland.org/presentations" title="">https://uxpacleveland.org/presentations</a>.

I've made a lot of friends and connections over the years from UXPA meetings & events.  It was also the reason I helmed IxDA Cleveland for a while.

It's a testament to all the committee members, speakers, and volunteers that gave us 19 years of community.  I learnt so many things, and expanded my scope because of them.

Thanks to everyone involved over the years.
