You wouldn't think it, but this is a commemorative  glass from a [beer festival](https://www.see.camra.org.uk "Campaign for Real Ale website"). It has had a black printed badge on the side. If you hold it in the light, you can make it out.

1971 to 1992

29 years ago I stood in the [Freight House](http://www.fusion-lifestyle.com/centres/the-freight-house/ ""), sipping a pint of Old Navigation from it, with Tony & Karl. Milling around the cold converted railway building, in November. The event couldn't take money for the beer, so you'd buy tokens (and the glass) as a workaround.

We'd each take the days off to attend. I would eat a 'Full English' from the cafe (long gone now) in Victoria Circus, before catching the bus from Southend. From 11am till 2pm we'd reminisce about working together, try new beers, and get tipsy in the middle of the day.

One year the surrounding pubs held a "real pie festival" at the same time. This was the first time I tried rabbit. 

It felt we did this forever. It was probably only 3 or 4 times. 

Much like the badge, these memories fade. Writing it down is like carrying the glass to States with me. Something to jog those memories when the time arises.
