Just finished '<a href="https://www.mickherron.com/titles/mick-herron-6/real-tigers/9781399803298/" title="">Real Tigers</a>', the third in Mick Herron's Slough House series. <strong>Fantastic!</strong>

After reading the first two, I watched the <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/slow-horses/umc.cmc.2szz3fdt71tl1ulnbp8utgq5o" title="">Apple TV+ adaptations</a> to remind myself of the world before diving into the next.  Gary Oldman does a great job bringing Jackson Lamb to life, and the whole production doesn't stray too far from the original material.

But something was missing from Slow Horses (TV), and after finishing Real Tigers (book) I figured out whatâ€”Pacing.

The breaking up into parts, need for cliffhangers, and filling of 6 episodes all works against what I can't get enough off in the books.

Herron's pacing makes you feel like you're watching an intricate clockwork machine unspooling in front of you. Getting faster & faster and there's nothing you, or his characters, can do about it.

I'll be starting 'Spook Street' soon.
