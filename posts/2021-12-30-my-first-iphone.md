Since "smart phones" came out I've been solely in Camp Android. But, as I wrote back in 2020, <a href="/posts/2020-08-05-google-losing-me/" title="my post from August 2020">Google has been slowly losing me</a>.

Google stopped sending software updates in October '20 to my aging Pixel 2. If it wasn't for it restarting randomly when I try to take a photo, listen to a podcast, or browse the web, I'd still be using it.

So I've opted to jump in and get an <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-13/" title="Apple product page">iPhone 13 mini</a>.

So far it's been great. I've only added back the bare minimum of apps;

- 1 Password
- Google Authenticator
- Hey (email)
- Pocket Casts (podcasts)
- NewsNetWire (RSS feeds)
- iBroadcast (music)
- Evernote (notes)
- Dropbox (files)
- Slack (messaging)

Making use of the native Reminders, Calendar, Facetime, and Messages with my Macbook Air has been really nice.

<strong>Not</strong> having YouTube, and other Google apps, pre-installed helps be more distraction free and bombarded less with advertising.

Hopefully it lasts as long as my Pixel 2 did.
