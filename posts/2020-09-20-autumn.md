The get-back-under-covers-quick cold had seeped into the house last night. Prompting the inaugural smell of Summer dust burning off as I fumbled with the nest app.

Autumn is finally here, with all that entails.

Halloween decorations are out of the tote bin, joined by some new additions.

Political advertising here in the USA ramps up invasiveness and divisiveness.

Requests for "your Xmas list" have started. Partly due to COVID-19's impact on availability of both goods & funds.

I generally like this time of year. Reminds me of picking conkers on the way to school. Years later, dozing off in the yellow lit commuter trains. Looking forward to beer festivals with a wide array of Porters and Barleywines.

The countdown to 2021 continues.
