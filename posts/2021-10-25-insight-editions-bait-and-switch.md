With the release of the new film [DUNE](http://www.dunemovie.com "official website") there was a lot of excitement about the films composer, Hans Zimmer, writing music to the accompanying book "The Art and Soul of DUNE". Insight Editions, the publisher, had a sign-up for a 'free download' of this.

The email was delivered with the subject line of "Download Hans Zimmer's exclusive soundtrack to THE ART AND SOUL OF DUNE now!" and a big button that reads 'Get my free download'

Click/touch that takes you to a page listing Amazon and iTunes as places you can download, but each of those want $10.49 to <strong>buy</strong> the soundtrack.

Clicking on Insight Editions social links in the email [revealed others confused](https://twitter.com/XRayLexx/status/1452567455159791617 "post on Twitter") as to where the free download was.


Their reply, on Facebook, to people running into the same issue as me was...

        <p>We apologize for the confusion. It's free to stream the book soundtrack on YouTube. For a download, you'll need to be subscribed to one of the services offered on the landing page or purchase the soundtrack on iTunes or Amazon.</p>

To me this smells like a straight forward bait-and-switch. No where did it mention the download was free, <em>only if</em> you were subscribed to a streaming service (that carried the album) that allowed downloads.
