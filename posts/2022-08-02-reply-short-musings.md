Great to read this. I have definitely found I need to reclaim my handwriting, and sketching, abilities again.

2 years of solo remote work took me out of the slower flow I enjoyed with pen & and paper.

Also getting back to meeting with friends (face-to-face) instead of over video or Slack has put a little bounce in my step.
