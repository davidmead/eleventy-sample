I am <a href="/posts/2023-09-04-the-pox" title="my new post">plagued with a literal pox</a>. For the last (checks notes) 3 weeks, confined to the house due to being contagious. I still have 1 more week until I'm freeâ€”Fingers crossed.

So, to pull me out of the dumps, how about an arbitrary photo challenge for September?

## Rules
<ul>
<li>1 photo a day</li>
<li>No repeats (avoid a selfie in the same chair 30 times)
<li>Shot, in landscape, on my iPhone 13 mini</li>
<li>Apply <a href="https://theeditingstudio.co/presets/vsco-p6-preset-for-lightroom-and-lightroom-mobile" title="Description of effect">the 'P6' filter</a> using <a href="https://www.vsco.co" title="">VSCOCAM app</a></li>
<li>Cropped to 16:9 ratio</li>
<li>Posted that day on my blog</li>
</ul>
Let's see what we end up.
