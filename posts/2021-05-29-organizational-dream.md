Lately I've noticed I've been having the same thoughts as I drift off to sleep. It goes like this.

I'm sitting at a wooden table in a rudimentary stone cottage. Apart from the table, chair, a wood-burning stove, and a ladder leading to a sleeping loft it's empty.

I'm a participant in a study to spend a year alone here. Apart from food & firewood, I have one hour to list out everything I need.

So I start making a list.

I never get very far. I guess it's my variant of [counting sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sheep "Wikipedia article").
