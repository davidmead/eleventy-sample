With the [Ohio Governor's order of "stay at home"](https://ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/site/media-center/news-and-events/ohio-issues-stay-at-home-order-and-new-restrictions-placed-on-day-cares-for-children "State website article"), I went Sunday and got my monitor, mouse, and keyboard from the office.

I had to re-attach the desktop to the legs as it shifted when I cleared it off. Now this is where I spend most of my work day.
