Since Google Play Music shuttered I've been looking for an alternative to play <em>my music collection</em> online. Be it on the web or streaming to Chromecast.

I've decided to give [iBroadcast](https://www.ibroadcast.com/home/) a go. They don't offer any streaming so it's <strong>only</strong> your music. It's free, with a subscription model on the horizon, and they have apps for iOS and Android.

It took about 24 hours to get my entire library onto iBroadcast and so far it's been working pretty well.
