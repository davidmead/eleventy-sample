I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://www.enoshop.co.uk/index" title="">Brian Eno</a>. Gary Huwsit (<a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/helvetica3" title="Watch on Vimeo">Helvetica</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/ramsfilm" title="Watch on Vimeo">Rams</a>) has now made a <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/eno" title="">documentary about him</a>.

Huwsit has made his film 'generative', meaning (like some of Eno's music) you'll never see the same version twice.

I doubt I'll get to see <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/craft/brian-eno-music-doc-ai-52-quintillion-versions-1234945990/" title="IndieWire article on Sundance premiere">one of those versions</a>, but I'm looking forward to a non-generative version being streamed soon.
