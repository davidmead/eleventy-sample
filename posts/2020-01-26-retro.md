Steamed Chinese pork bun and a strong cuppa for breakfast.

A day of catching up on old things.

After cleaning the house I decided to start clearing out my 'Watch later' on YouTube:
* [Our Norwegian Tiny Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv73ByzrcdA)
* [Oldest Inn(1958)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKsSM-8iRlE "Pathe news archive film")
* [The Gates of the City of London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PHLgrYJLTk "Londonist short")
* [Londons Lost Railways-Mill Hill East](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJj7QaTtb2s "Londonist Short")
* [The Unfinished Northern Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuD288JlCs "film by Jay Foreman")

Listened & watched [Sam Aaron live coding an ambient electro set w/ Sonic Pi](https://youtu.be/G1m0aX9Lpts) followed by an hour of [brian eno - thursday afternoon (14 video paintings 1981-1984)](https://youtu.be/Riz6AKeBpa0).
