## Getting ready
After having multiple occasions of not having power and/or heat over the years, I decided to shell out for these:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.anker.com/products/a1760?variant=42025975873686" title="direct link, not affliate">Anker 555 Portable power station</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.mrheater.com/portable-buddy-heater.html" title="irect link, not affliate">Mr. Heater Portable Buddy® Propane Heater</a></li>
</ul>
And while I’m no hardy backwoods prepper, I can attest it’s just as cold at night on New Years Eve without a furnace in my suburban home, as in a log cabin.

Here's hoping I won't need them.

## Meeting friends
With the first week of November being in the high 70's, I made the most of it and met up with some friends. Also a good excuse to try some new beers too.

Last week was with my gaming buddy Jim at <a href="https://goldhornbrewery.com" title="">Goldhorn Brewery</a>, where I <a href="https://untappd.com/user/davidmead/checkin/1217894506" title="my Untappd entry">enjoyed a pint of Pole Licker</a>. A nice crisp IPA. Not too hoppy, and went down well with the loaded fries & schloppy sauce.

Couple of days ago I finally got to sit down again with Ken & Bob. Two colleagues from my time at Progressive.  Settling in at <a href="https://bossdogbrewing.com" title="">Boss Dog Brewing</a> I had a couple <a href="https://untappd.com/user/davidmead/checkin/1219513720" title="my Untappd entry">pints of Uncle Knuckles Christmas Ale</a>. A robust dark ale, great for catching up after 2 years.

## Temperature drops

From rolled-up sleeves and widows open, to being in the 30's today and the first snow settling on car roofs.

I did pick-up a new snow shovel, as well as 3 bags of pet-friendly ice melt this week, so we won't be caught short if it starts to come down heavy.

Winter is here.
