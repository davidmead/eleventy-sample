I just read that <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/iceland-nithing-pole" title="Atlas Obscura article">an ancient way to curse people, by sticking a horse head on a pole</a>, is still going on in Iceland. It's called a níðstöng, or “nithing pole”.

This week saw the Start of the Descending Frost

It got to be <strong>78℉ in the house</strong> today. We had all the windows open. It's supposed to be Sōkō!

I'd been looking forward to a celebratory work deliverable. Proud of the work that'd been put in, by everyone involved. Turned (and continues to be) sour, contentious, and personally disheartening.

I have 3 weeks of unused vacation time—Maybe it's time for some distance.
