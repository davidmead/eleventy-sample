I wrote about how <a href="/posts/2023-08-17-youtube-shame-pop-up/" title="">YouTube emptied my homepage</a> because I have my watch history turned off. An option they offer.

Now I can no longer watch <strong>any videos on YouTube</strong><sup><a href="#footnote1" title="">1</a></sup> because I run an <a href="https://www.magiclasso.co" title="Magic Lasso">Ad-Blocker</a> in my browser.

For a while I got this pop-up, with a close button that only appeared after a timer had run.

<img class="img-border" height="1564" width="846" src="/img/ss-youtube-popup-01.png" alt="Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube">

Yesterday that was replaced by this pop-up. Giving me three strikes then I'm cut off.

<img class="img-border" height="1548" width="1074" src="/img/ss-youtube-popup-02.png" alt="Video player will be blocked after 1 video">

Then after watching 3 videos, the final pop-up is this, which replaces the video completely.

<img class="img-border" height="1548" width="1074" src="/img/ss-youtube-popup-03.png" alt="message states Video playback is blocked unless YouTube is allowlisted or the ad blocker is disabled.">

Each time I'm given the opportunity to whitelist YouTube in the Ad Blocker, or pay for YouTube Premium. Neither of which I <del>will</del> want to do.

It seems YouTube has been this rolling this out globally. Alexander Hanff <q>filed a formal complaint against #YouTube with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner for their illegal deployment of #adblock detection technologies.</q> today, which he <a href="https://eupolicy.social/@thatprivacyguy/111261130799704016" title="">posted about on Mastadon</a> (hattip <a href="https://ctmiller.net" title="" rel="friend">Chris</a>).

I think I'll take this as a sign to step away from the last "social media" site I use for a while. Maybe breaking the habit will be good for me.
