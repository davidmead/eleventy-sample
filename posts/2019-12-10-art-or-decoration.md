We have a 'Main Street' at my work. The centre place on our ground floor. This year it contains this great piece.

We have art all around the HQ (not surprising with one of [our owners](https://www.cleveland.com/arts/2019/12/dealer-tire-ceo-scott-mueller-leads-by-example-as-new-chairman-of-cleveland-museum-of-art.html "newspaper article") is Chairman of Cleveland Museum of Art) and having something like this beats the normal corporate Xmas trees you see at a lot of places.
