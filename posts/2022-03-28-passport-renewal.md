One of the (many) reasons I made the trip back to the UK, when I did, was my passport was going to expire.

Today I headed over to <a href="https://www.gov.uk" title="British Government website">https://www.gov.uk</a>, searched for 'passport' and chose 'renew'.

I answered some simple questions, uploaded a photo Julie took of me with my iPhone, and paid the fee. Tomorrow I mail off my old passport. Within 11 weeks I <em>should</em> get a brand new one back.

This beats the experience a decade ago of getting multiple photos taken in the USA (to UK passport standards), having them signed (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/jkrohrs" title="Twitter profile" rel="met friend">Jeff</a>), filling in forms and mailing the whole packet off with a cheque.
