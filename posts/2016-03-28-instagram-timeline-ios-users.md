To show their displeasure at this, some people are posting images with arrows indicating where to change settings. This will #KeepInstagramChronological.

Here’s the problem. They all seem to be iOS users. How do I know? Because none of the ways I use Instagram have anything where the arrow is pointing.

Just another reminder that everyone’s experience is different.
