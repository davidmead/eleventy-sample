This morning I hopped in the car and drove, about 40 minutes, to [Hudson](https://www.hudson.oh.us/ "official city website"). I had a gift certificate for [The Learned Owl bookshop](https://www.learnedowl.com/ "") and decide to combine spending that with grabbing a coffee with an [old friend](https://ctmiller.net/pages/about.html "Chris's about page").

For an over hour we sat in the [Open Door Coffee Co.](https://opendoorcoffeecompany.com/ ""). Less than 6 feet apart, maskless and in opposite leather chairs, sipping coffee and talking. People came and went. The sun shone. And for a while it felt it could've been any Saturday in 2019.

Then it was time to re-enter 2021.

Masks on, we said our goodbyes and I went and picked up my book. Past the make-shift barriers that enclose virtually all cash registers, having to repeat the odd word every now and again.

We're slowly getting back.
