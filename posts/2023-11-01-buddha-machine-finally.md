If it wasn't for <a href="https://disquiet.com/2023/10/28/scratch-pad-buddha-machine-phones-criterion/" title="Marc Weidenbaum blog post">Mark buying one</a> last week over at Disquiet.com I would've missed it, <strong>again</strong>!

I've been after one since reading about the original launch (probably via Marc) back in 2005. Over the years I've either not had the spare cash, or they've been out-of-stock.

<a href="https://www.fm3buddhamachine.com" title="official site">The Buddha Machine</a> was designed by Christiaan Virant and Zhang Jian (jointly as FM3) in Beijing, China.

Described as <q>a strangely hypnotic journey of 9 generative looped tracks that are addictive to body and soul. All of this, simply seamlessly integrated into a box the size of a box of playing cards</q>.

Grab the <a href="https://www.memeantenna.com/products/fm3-buddha-machine-1-2023-reissue" title="product page">2023 reissue from MeMeAntenna</a> while stocks last, if you're interested.
