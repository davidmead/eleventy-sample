With James growing so fast it was inevitable that there'd be diapers he never used.

A quick search and I left a message at the <a href="https://diaperbankgc.org" title="">Diaper Bank of Greater Cleveland</a>.

Today I headed down to the Cleveland Foodbank (where they share space) and dropped off about 14 packs of assorted sizes of diapers.
