Back in March I wrote about traveling back to the UK as <a href="/posts/2022-03-06-sitting/" title="sitting">Mum was ill</a>.

On May 11th Sharon called with the news she'd died. It was quiet, restful. She was at Sharon's house, surrounded by family.

Josh and I are getting ready to travel back the UK this week.  Her ashes are to be interred with my Dad's at Southed Crematorium.

We're having a remembrance with a few of her closest friends.

I haven't felt like posting. I hadn't known what to post. It hit me hard, but I'm sure when I get to see my sister the floodgates will really open.

I miss her.
