I was in Mentor on Friday and treated myself to lunch at <a href="https://kikos-kitchen.square.site" title="Japanese style food made fresh">Kiko's Kitchen</a>. I went for a Chicken Katsu rice bowl, but they also had a special Potato & Vegetable Croquette served with Katsu sauce (photo).

There were delicious!
