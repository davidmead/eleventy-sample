Thanks to a [post by Terence Eden](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/10/slideshare-is-selling-your-old-slides-heres-how-to-stop-it/ "") I'm once again reminded that companies are taking advantage of our eagerness to share content, via the web, in the early 2000's.

SlideShare, where I have 6 old presentations apparently, has started to monetize when people download them. But we don't get a share of that obviously.

Followed Terence's lead and marked that 'users can download without a subscription'.

I also took the opportunity to update my password.
