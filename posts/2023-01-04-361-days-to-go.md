Out went the tree, and down came the decorations, today. 2 days early I know, but local rubbish pick-up doesn't coincide with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Days_of_Christmas" title="Wikipedia entry for 12 Days of Christmas">Twelvetide</a>.

Though New Years Day is behind us, and Xmas is a <a href="https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/2022-12-23-winter-storm-elliott-bomb-cyclone-midwest-northeast-winds-snow" title="article on Weather.com">wintery bomb cyclone</a> memory, we'll be exchanging gifts this weekend due to Julie's Dad being in hospitalâ€”He's recovering.

No retrospective for last year (it was a mixed bag), and no resolutions for this year (don't believe in making them). Just aiming to read more, eat less, and keep my head above water.

4 down, 361 to go.
