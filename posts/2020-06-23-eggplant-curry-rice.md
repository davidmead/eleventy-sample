I very rarely make anything from YouTube videos but this looked great, and I had most of the ingredients, so why not?

It was so good, both Josh and I had it two days in a row. You can watch (and follow) [RunnyRunny999's video](https://youtu.be/Bc3olP5d4Uc "YouTube") on YouTube.

As with most curry its flavour only improved overnight in the fridge.
