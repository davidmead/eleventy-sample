I've been a fan of [Dan Cederholm](https://simplebits.com/pages/about "About page") since the early 2000's. His blog was among those I visited everyday.

I have bought his books in the past, and now he's [having a sale](https://simplebits.com/collections/tees "$10 t-shirts") so I grabbed a couple of t-shirts he designed.

These are super comfy and I really love the designs.

I'm looking forward to seeing the new ones coming soon.
