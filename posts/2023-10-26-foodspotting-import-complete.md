<a href="/posts/2021-04-28-documenting-food/" title="My Documenting Food post">Back in 2021</a> I posted about starting to add all my exported Foodspotting posts to this site. Today I finished.

All <a href="/tags/foodspotting/" title="everything tagged foodspotting">178 posts</a>, from 2011â€“2017. An on-and-off documenting of breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.

It was a fun having my memory jogged by seeing the restaurant names, or photo of a dish. Trips taken, happy hours with co-workers, day's out with the family.

Few things I noticed.

I had a lot of <a href="/posts/2016-11-17-foodspotting/" title="">Lunch Buffets from Bombay Chaat</a>.

A lot of places are now closed.

Some like <a href="/posts/2017-02-08-foodspotting/" title="Coastal bowl">Cafe 55</a> and <a href="/posts/2018-03-02-foodspotting-2/" title="Raspberry And Lemon Doughnut">Bigmouth Donuts</a> occupied the same space, one after another.
