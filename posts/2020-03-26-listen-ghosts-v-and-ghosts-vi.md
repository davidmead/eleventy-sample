As a lot of us are sitting around, self-isolating, Trent Reznor releases two new instrumental works in his 'Ghosts' series.

> As the news seems to turn ever more grim by the hour, we’ve found ourselves vacillating wildly between feeling like there may be hope at times to utter despair – often changing minute to minute. Although each of us define ourselves as antisocial-types who prefer being on our own, this situation has really made us appreciate the power and need for CONNECTION.

Both come with a colon title - Ghosts V:Together and Ghosts VI:Locusts...

>Ghosts V: Together is for when things seem like it might all be okay, and Ghosts VI: Locusts… well, you’ll figure it out.

I've now found the starter to my Pandemic iPod playlist. Both albums can be downloaded for free.
