As a lot of us are sitting around, self-isolating, Trent Reznor releases two new instrumental works in his 'Ghosts' series.

    <blockquote cite="https://www.nin.com/nine-inch-nails-ghosts-v-vi-available-now/">
        <p>As the news seems to turn ever more grim by the hour, we’ve found ourselves vacillating wildly between feeling like there may be hope at times to utter despair – often changing minute to minute. Although each of us define ourselves as antisocial-types who prefer being on our own, this situation has really made us appreciate the power and need for CONNECTION.</p>

Both come with a colon title - Ghosts V:Together and Ghosts VI:Locusts...

        <p>Ghosts V: Together is for when things seem like it might all be okay, and Ghosts VI: Locusts… well, you’ll figure it out.</p>

I've now found the starter to my Pandemic iPod playlist. Both albums can be downloaded for free.
