Got dinner early, walked the dogs, set up the chairs, and waited.

Julie did the passing out, with me in reserve in case she needed a break. We had more people that last year (understandable), but still nothing like it used to be.

I think Julie was right. As the population ages, activity shifts. Around us all the people that would be trick-or-treating are now Josh's age (17) and older. Other parts of our town are having a load more costumed kids knocking on doors.

But the rain held off and it wasn't too cold. And we have a few leftovers in the bottom of the cauldron.
