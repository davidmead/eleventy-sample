I remember attending the  SXSWi 2011 panel [Banks! Innovate or die](https://austin2011.sched.com/event/2Y3q/banks-innovate-or-die "Panel overview on SCHED.com") and being impressed by the lively discussion. Especially Joshua Reich, the CEO of Simple at that point.

[Simple](https://simple.com) had been going for a couple of years at that point, but seeing Joshua made me want to have them as my bank. Two things stand out from [my notes](https://davidmead-sxswi11.tumblr.com/post/3808589222/session-2 "post on Tumblr") on that panel.

1. Josh's <q>Bankers are poor at dealing with people</q> statement was, and is, so true
2. Like it or not, banks are now too big and can/will absorb these other types.  Not to the say they can't learn something

Now, a decade later, [Simple is closing](https://www.simple.com/blog/simple-is-closing). It was sold to BBVA USA, they in turn are being bought by PNC Bank. The Verge has a [good round-up](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219271/simple-bank-online-shutting-down-pnc-bbva "The Verge article") on the history and announcement.

My experience with Simple has been nothing but <strong>excellent</strong>. The rare times I had to call I always spoke to someone directly who helped. Never had to call multiple times. The website and app were great and have influenced a lot of the changes traditional banks have made with their offerings.

I will miss the clarity in their email, messaging, and UI. I'll miss seeing exactly what is 'Safe-to-Spend' and having 'Goals' to squirrel away small amounts to pay for a specific thing later on. In a [tweet](https://twitter.com/i2pi/status/1347266937932316673) Joshua said

> Our first mission statement was to help people worry less about money. It morphed to ‘help people feel confidence’. Either way, we wanted to help people.

I feel they achieved this in my eyes.

Reddit users have now started a [Google Sheet to compare features](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Etr8dGtviSRpdAjREgBErc47SlqMVjwZDJjHKxX7eOk/edit#gid=0) from Simple to other banks, helping people to choose an alternative. It's clear there are very few that can compare.
