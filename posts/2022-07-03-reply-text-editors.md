I used to enjoy <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com" title="Text editor">Hemingway</a> for drafting posts etc., but it's not been updated for years now and is flaky.

<a href="https://nova.app" title="code editor from Panic">Nova</a> is what I use for coding and posting to my site. <a href="https://evernote.com" title="">Evernote</a> is still my outboard brain for saving notes, some rough drafts.

Apple Notes (in concert with Reminders) is my go-to for quick notes for between devices.
