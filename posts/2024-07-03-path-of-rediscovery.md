With the new audio setup, I've been making time to deliberately sit and listen. Using Roon's “<a href="https://help.roonlabs.com/portal/en/kb/articles/faq-what-s-radio-and-how-does-it-work" title="FAQ on this feature">Radio</a>” feature has been great for shuffling through my local library, surfacing tracks I'd completely forgotten about.

One such track was "Note of repose (sketch_13/06/25)" by Nobuto Suda. A shimmering ambient piece. It had a delightful illustration as its cover.

I had <strong>zero</strong> recollection of this track. Didn't recognize the artist name, cover, or music. I assumed it was from one of the many sample or collections I'd bought, but no. Looking in Roon it was from 'unknown album' and this was the only track by them.

Also, Roon had no further information about the track or the artist.

Doing a search for <q>note of repose (sketch_13/06/25) nobuto suda</q> brought me to a <a href="https://disquiet.com/2013/06/25/nobuto-suda-note-of-repose/" title="Disquiet blog">2013 post by Marc Weidenbaum</a> (naturally). He'd found it on Soundcloud and shared it.

From there I followed his link to <a href="https://nobutosuda.bandcamp.com" title="">Nobuto Suda's Bandcamp page</a>, where I'm now looking at which album of his to buy first.

From Roon, to Disquiet, to Bandcamp.
