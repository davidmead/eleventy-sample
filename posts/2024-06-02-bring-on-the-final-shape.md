<a href="https://www.destinythegame.com/en/the-final-shape" title="Official Bungie page">The Final Shape</a> is the last chapter in Destiny's "Light & Darkness" saga. It's such a big expansion that the game will be offline for 25 hours.

That means I had to; craft everything I need, spend in-game currency (most of which is being deprecated), delete items to clear space in my vault, and run any last missions over the weekend to get those missing weapons.

I've made my peace with <abbr title="fear of missing out">FOMO</abbr> and switching it off.

It's scheduled to start at June 4, 1:00 p.m. EST. I'm sure they'll be a queue, possibly some general server glitches. There always is with something this big, but Bungie's track record has been pretty good in the past.

I am <em>really</em> looking forward to playing this. I've taken a couple of day's off to jump right in. Feel free to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/davidmead" title="my twitch channel">drop by my Twitch</a> as I'll be streaming it.
