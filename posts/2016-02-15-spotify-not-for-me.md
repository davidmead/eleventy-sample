I was interested to hear some music shared on Twitter, but the link was to Spotify. I don’t have an account, but the @Spotify username I wanted freed up. So I installed, tried, got instantly annoyed, then uninstalled.

Guess I’m just stuck in my way of listening, but having “similar” tracks inserted into album that I can only listen to on shuffle, is ridiculous. Also I only get to skip a few tracks then “discover” a premium feature to unlock is a ridiculous gamification ploy.

I know a whole of people like this way of consuming and discovering music, but it’s just not for me.

Same reasons why I don’t use the radio stations in Google Play.

Back to the blogs, podcasts, and personal recommendations for me.
