We had to make the difficult decision to put Max to sleep this week.

We'd adopted him when <a href="/posts/2023-12-07-my-mother-in-law-died/" title="">Linda died</a>. He was 15, half deaf & blind, and the vet's nickname for him was "grumpy old man".

Though he had his moments, I'll miss him laying against my beanbag while playing Xbox.

We'll miss you Max.
