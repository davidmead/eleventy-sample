I've posted the <a href="/posts/2021-12-01-sausage-gravy/" title="">sausage gravy recipe</a> I follow here before. This was only the second time I've made the biscuits from scratch though. For something so "simple" it can still be quite stress inducing.

I followed the directions from [Sugar Spun Run](https://youtu.be/aA6tmTVVfk4 "YouTube video")'s video. Her instructions were clear and concise. Good tip was putting the butter in the freezer for 10-20 minutes, then grating it.

I don't bother with pressing out rounds. Just use a knife to divide the dough into 6 squares.

### Ingredients
<ul>
<li class="p-ingredient">2 cups all purpose flour</li>
<li class="p-ingredient">1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
<li class="p-ingredient">1 tablespoon sugar</li>
<li class="p-ingredient">1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li class="p-ingredient">6 tablespoons unsalted butter (very cold)</li>
<li class="p-ingredient">&frac34; cup of milk</li>
</ul>

<div class="e-instructions">

### Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 425&deg;F
2. Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl
3. Grate in cold butter, mix with a fork until it looks like a course crumble
4. Stir in milk, with spoon, until dough gets "shaggy"
5. Flour a surface (and your hands) and turn out the dough
6. Fold, turn 90&deg;, fold again. Repeat this about 6 times using only your hands
7. Form into a rectangle (about 1" thick) and cut / press out biscuits
8. Cook for about 15 minutes
