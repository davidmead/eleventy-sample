While going through multiple boxes in the loft I found a box of Dad's old cassette tapes.  He used to decorate a lot of them with felt-tip. A big childhood memory for me.

Marc posted that his father had recently died. He's also been going through <a href="https://disquiet.com/2022/06/24/perfect-sound-forever/" title="">his late father's collection</a>.

Funny how my parents (and both their parents) left behind 78's, 45's, vinyl albums, tapes, and CDs. None of which I <em>had</em> to play to invoke a memory.

All Josh will have is 10 CDs and some external drives full of MP3s.  I doubt they will illicit the same in him.
