I saw that the owners were <a href="https://www.clevescene.com/food-drink/empress-taytu-owners-looking-to-sell-business-building-and-retire-41210482" title="article on Cleveland Scene">looking to sell Empress Tatyu and retire</a> after 31 years in business.

I've only eaten Ethiopian cuisine twice. One of those times at Empress Tatyu.  This is the latest of a spate of Cleveland institutions closing.

I mentioned it on Slack and <a href="https://ctmiller.net" title="Chris Miller blog" rel="friend met">Chris</a> arranged a reservation.

Josh & I arrived at 6.30pm. Meeting Rachel, Laura & Kris, Chris & Cathrine, and Tina & Damon.

The place was packed, staff friendly, and the smells were great as you enter by the kitchen.

After some appetizers I ordered the Meat and Veggie Combo.  This consisted of Dorowat (Chicken), Tikil Gomen (Vegetable Stew), Kik-alicha (Yellow Split Peas), and Misir (Red Lentils).  All of this served of a bed of Injera (sour-fermented pancake).

It was delicious, and very filling.  I also got to try some of the lamb the Cathrine ordered. Also delicious.

We ended the evening with the Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony...

Though it took a while for our main courses to arrive, the time flew by as we had some great conversation and enjoyed spending time with friends.  I'm also glad that Josh had the opportunity to try new tastes in this part of Cleveland history.
