<p>It has been hard not to think of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. It’s been hard not to think we’re at best in the chorus. That we are slogging through history as everyone has always slogged through history. Taking a long walk outside, while that’s still an option. Picking up a meal, while we can afford to. Talking to friends and family, while they’re still around. Somewhere the tragic protagonist is finally brought low. The audience roars. The curtain falls. In the background we labor on. Trying to make a life in the debris.</p>
