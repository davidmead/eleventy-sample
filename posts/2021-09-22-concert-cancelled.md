Just got the email from Ticketmaster that November's concert by Dead Can Dance has been cancelled.

        <p>Having monitored the current COVID-19 situation carefully like everyone has, it has been decided that we cannot put the health and safety of the musicians, crew, promoters, venue staff, and most importantly the fans at potential risk by touring in October.</p>

I was so looking forward to this.

My hope is that December's Genesis concert will still be a go.
