There's two main games I play on the Xbox.  The Division 2, and Destiny 2. <a href="/tags/thedivision2/" title="more of my posts about The Division">The Division 2</a> has been going through some issues recently and updates are coming, albeit slowly.

Destiny on the other hand is storming along. Season after season, with 2 more years of content already planned.

The current season's storyline has had some great writing. Maybe it hit me due to personal events, but handling grief, regret, and working through the baggage you carry around was very effective.

## Solar 3.0
One of the biggest changes Destiny made was to overhaul how a lot of powers work. This season it was Solar's turn.

I put together a build that is a lot of fun to play.  It's <a href="https://dim.gg/nbyueui/Solar-3.0-Sunspot" title="Build on Destiny Inventory Manager">Warlock with Sunbracer gauntlets and the Sunshot exotic hand cannon</a>.

Basically when you kill NPCs they blow, causing everything around them to blow up too. This drops "wells" which, when you pick them up, give you more weapon damage. And the cycle continues.

And this seasons armor and shaders were very cool. See this screenshot of my current Warlock.

## Older secrets
And with this being a huge game there a lot of secret challenges you can do.  I never seem to get around to all of these during a season, but thanks to YouTube I've managed to find the <a href="https://youtu.be/pH2n6_7G9yw" title="Video guide from Time Sausage on YouTube">9 dead exo's on Europa</a>, the <a href="https://youtu.be/c8gMlEe6UVk" title="Video guide from Esoterickk on YouTube">9 hidden Penguin toys</a>, as well as recovering the <a href="https://youtu.be/CYTIU8gioBM" title="Time Sausage's video guide">lost dead ghosts</a> <em>and</em> all <a href="https://youtu.be/POgn_lB6jt4" title="YouTube video guide from Time Sausage">the hidden rabbits</a> on the Moon.

## Next Season
Season of the Haunted is ending soon. I'm looking forward to see where they take the storyline next. Also if we're getting an overhaul of the Arc power too.
