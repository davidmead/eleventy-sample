In the 90's there were 3 big comic series I waited with baited breath on every issue; [The Sandman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(comic_book) "Wikipedia page"), [Hellblazer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer "Wikipedia"), and [Cerebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark "Wikipedia").

I am a big fan of [Neil Gaiman](http://neilgaiman.com "official site"), and his work. So when [Netflix announced](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-sandman-latest-castings-and-the-stories-behind-them "") its casting for the 'live action' version of The Sandman I was interested. And what a "dream" cast (pun intended) it is. But apparently not everyone thought so.

There's backlash about the announcement using [gender pronouns](https://lgbtlifecenter.org/pronouns/ "explainer from LGBT Life Center") under the actors names. But the bigger backlash seems to be about casting [Kirby Howell-Baptiste](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4624730/ "IMDB page") as 'Death'.

I find this **astounding** to say the least. My first encounters with non-stereotyped POC, gay, or gender-fluid, characters _in literature_ was in those Sandman comics.

He's had the opportunity to shape his stories for TV and audio - Changing them to suit the times and medium before. To have the creator now have a voice in shaping how _his_ Sandman stories are told & performed, in a new medium, should be a cause for celebration. 

Apparently not. So much so that Neil Gaiman felt he had to [respond on Twitter](https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/1398500390912413698 "").

        <p>I give all the fucks about the work. I spent 30 years successfully battling bad movies of Sandman.</p>

<p>I give zero fucks about people who don't understand/ haven't read Sandman whining about a non-binary Desire or that Death isn't white enough. Watch the show, make up your minds.</p>

And the verbal knots some tie themselves up in to prove this isn't being racist, is unbelievable.

I will probably not watch the Netflix show. For the same reason I didn't watch 'American Gods' or 'Good Omens'. I've already read & enjoyed those books, and I'm more interested in the new stories that Neil has to tell.

But I am excited for others to discover the world of The Sandman on Netflix, and maybe find their way to other stories from Neil.
