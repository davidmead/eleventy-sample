Today the US Congress met to confirm the next President, Joe Biden. We knew that some Republicans that hitched their wagon to Trump would object, causing multiple 2 hour debates. Prolonging, but not changing, the outcome.

President Trump called for a rally of his loyal supporters. Told them to <q>use their strength</q> and get to the hill. They did march and didn't stop. Forcing themselves into the Capitol while this meeting was going on.

>Protesters in support of US President Donald Trump swarmed the Capitol building, forcing officials to order lawmakers to shelter in place and halting debate in both the House and Senate. Congress was meeting to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's electoral college victory.

[Shocking photos](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55568131 "BBC News photos") capture what we watched live happen.

What's normally a ceremonial pitstop most Americans never watch, became an international news story. A woman was shot and killed in this action.

Trump released a video (on Twitter) wrapping a weak request for his supporters to go home, with the continued lie that he won. [Twitter has suspended his account](https://globalnews.ca/news/7559126/trump-twitter-suspension-calls-violence-us-capitol-protest/ "Globalnews story") for 12 hours.

Congress started proceedings after <strong>The National Guard</strong> and Federal police cleared the building and pronounce it safe.

It's now 10pm and they are still going.
