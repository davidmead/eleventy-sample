We were gifted a jar of homemade kimchi.  This is <strong>delicious!</strong>

But now I'm the only one in the house who'll eat something like this, I wanted to try something new.

A quick search revealed a Korean stew named <a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/budae-jjigae-army-stew/" rel="external" title="Korean cooking blog recipe">Budae Jjigae</a>, or "Army Stew".

Now I didn't have everything in the house to follow the recipe exactly, but I did have Spam, Broth, Ramen, Kimchi, Onions, Scallions, and Garlic.

I fried the Spam first, then added the Kimchi.  I poured in the broth, kimchi juice, onions, garlic, and a dash of sugar. Let the whole thing bubble away then added the ramen.  That did soak up a lot of the broth, but it tasted great.

If we get any more of that Kimchi I will make it again.
