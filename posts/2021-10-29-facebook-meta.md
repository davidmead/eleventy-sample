I watched some of the [Facebook/Meta announcement](https://about.facebook.com/meta "") and, it was pretty lackluster and disappointing.

As “an old” I remember <em>better</em> versions of what they think the "[Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse "Wikipedia entry")" is from bad sci-fi in the 70's & 80's. The best Zuckerberg can offer is still poking at translucent panels hovering above a desk? Really?

The avatars look like ones Nintendo didn’t end up using on the Wii, but without legs.

Even the future vision stuff was lacking. Mainly aimed at business hybrid working solutions and selling access to services &amp; art.

## Back to the future
I remember visiting [Olympia London](https://olympia.london "Exhibition Center") in the 90's and trying a VR headset. I could walk around and battle a dragon. It was fantastic. [Tomorrow's World covered it in 1990](https://youtu.be/T2CYLlSn1gA "video on YouTube") and [Howard Rheingold](http://rheingold.com "official site") wrote a [great book](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL1533251M/Virtual_reality "Virtual reality book at Open Library") on the subject.  That was <strong>30 years ago</strong> and there's been no real advances apart better graphics and a smaller headset.

I don't see any of this coming to fruition in the next decade, at least.

## Name change

The other thing in this announcement was Facebook (the company) re-branding to Meta.

I get the need to distance the company name from the platform (and all its [current troubles](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1049015366/the-facebook-papers-what-you-need-to-know "NPR article about the Facebook Papers")), but I think this misses the mark. Zuckerberg is putting all of his eggs (and his Millions) into this basket, but this smells more of folly than a sure-thing.
