Back in 2021 I jotted down my thoughts on what <a href="/posts/2021-09-11-this-website-when-i-die/" title="">would happen to this site after I died</a>.

Maudlin I know, but I'm over 50 so...

Wordpress recently announced its <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/08/25/introducing-the-100-year-plan/" title="">100 Year Plan</a>. For $38,000 you'll get:
<ul><li>Century-long domain registration</li>
<li>Backups and Internet Archive submittal</li>
<li>Enhanced ownership protocols</li>
<li>Hosting</li>
<li>Premier support</li></ul>

All-in-all a great deal, and things I mentioned would be this sites downfall.

The 100 Year Plan also got Chris Coyier thinking, and wrote about <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2023/09/18/how-long-does-free-hosting-last/" title="">how long free hosting lasts</a>. SPOILER! Not as long as you think.

This was one of the reasons <a href="/posts/2023-02-19-moving-hosts/" title="">I moved hosting</a>. My "lifetime" free hosting ended with GoDaddy buying Media Temple.

Nothing is forever. Even Wordpress stops at a century.
