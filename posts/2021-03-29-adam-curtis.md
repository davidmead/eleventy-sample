[Adam Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis "Wikipedia entry") has developed a very particular style for his films. Stock footage, bold sans-serif font overlays, and a certain cadence to his measured speech. It's easy to imitate and [pastiche](https://www.tomscott.com/infinite-adam-curtis/ "Tom Scott's infinite Adam Curtis documentary"). Quite a few people I know don't like his films, but I find them interesting, engrossing.

His latest for the BBC, titled "[Can't Get You Out Of My Head](https://youtu.be/MHFrhIAj0ME "Watch part one on YouTube")", is available on his YouTube channel as 6 (one hour) installments. Adam describes it as...

    <blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/MHFrhIAj0ME">
        <p>We are living through strange days. Across Britain, Europe and America societies have become split and polarised. There is anger at the inequality and the ever growing corruption - and a widespread distrust of the elites. Into this has come the pandemic that has brutally dramatised those divisions. But despite the chaos, there is a paralysis - a sense that no one knows how to escape from this.</p>

He's pulling seemingly separate historical strands together.  Showing how the effects of action by disparate forces impact and shape others. Mao's wife. The British Empire creating Iran. The rise of suburbs in America, to name a few.

All this gives rise to conspiracy theories, amplified by the rise of the internet and (he posits) our inability to accept any other way. 

His use of archive footage and music choices do not reflect the actual historic events. Rather they give a sense of mood and place. For me this aids his narrative. Underscoring the threads he presents.

I don't see his work as a traditional documentarian. I'm more inline with [Stewart Lee](https://www.stewartlee.co.uk "official site") who said

        <p>...it's a sort of bloke going look at this. What about this? Oh that's weird init. It's like a sort of ramble around someone's brain whose been stuck in a cellar with too much archive footage. It's not meant to be Panorama.</p>

Again, I'm a fan. I don't agree with everything he puts forward, but find the topics appealing.  Take a watch and see for yourself.
