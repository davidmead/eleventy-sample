Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram have rampant ads and skewed toxicity that the companies can't (or won't) address.

Large swathes of "online news" sites are echo chambers from half-read tweets riding on anger and clickbait thumbnails & titles.

Even the community of how we build and publish on the web feels angry and combative.

So, I'm going to take a break. Log out from these places. Shutter this site (I may take it down) as I still can't get it working the way I want.

I have hope for [the IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/ "Indieweb") gaining more traction. I have hope that this is a dark valley social media can pull itself out from.

See you whenever. Have a better one.
