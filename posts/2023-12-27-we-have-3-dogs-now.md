We've adopted my Mother-in-law's dog, Max.

We were worried how he'd get along with other dogs. Being 14, an old man in dog years, he was set in his ways. Also losing some vision & hearing makes it difficult.

But with only one "accident" he settled in really quickly.

There's still the occasionally squabble, but all three now join in barking & howling at whatever is passing by our large Living Room window.
