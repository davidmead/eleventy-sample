Blogs are great. And RSS feeds are how a lot of people consume those blogs.

It's how I find out about new blogs too. Someone posts a link to something they follow.

I recently added a 'blogroll' on my home page. And to that I've just added a link to <a href="/Subscriptions-DJMFeeds.opml" title="OPML file"><em>all</em> the feeds I'm following</a> at the moment.

I use <a href="https://netnewswire.com" title="RSS feed reader for Mac">NetNewsWire</a> as my feed reader. It's nice & simple. Works on Mac, and iOS. And it's free.

Doing a simple export from there gives me an <abbr title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</abbr> file. That's the file I've uploaded and linked to.

Feel free to import into your feed reader of choice.

You may find something interesting.
