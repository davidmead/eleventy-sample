He returned from dropping off clothes at the Goodwill with a "new" camera. A [Polaroid 600](https://us.polaroid.com/products/square-600-polaroid-camera " ") with one cartridge of film. Proclaiming the film (at $20) cost more than the camera, we went online to find a manual.

With just 8 shots in each cartridge he's now looking at subjects a little more carefully, but still having a lot of fun.
