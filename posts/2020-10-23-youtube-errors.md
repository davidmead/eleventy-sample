<p>It used to be just the odd clip from a news outlet I had unpause my adblocker to watch. Now virtually all of my subscriptions (even from the UK) are returning an error on YouTube when the adblocker is running.</p>

<p>I tried, for a week, YouTube unblocked and what a nightmare. And not because of the looming election (though Trumps ads were the only I got) but diets, metal roofs, food delivery and soaps. Anything longer than 5 minutes had ads inserted. Pre and post roll ads too. Not forgetting the overlaid banners.</p>

<p>Now I'm back using the blocker, and missing out on a lot of the content I've subscribed to.</p>
