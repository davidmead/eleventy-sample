A CD player that looks and works like a record playerâ€”Beautiful.

I love (and miss) this kind of design project.

This is a proof-of-concept, that <a href="https://www.red-dot.org/project/vivia-turntable-for-compact-discs-65882" title="">won a reddot Design Award</a>, from Jaehyung Chu. You can read more on his <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/173448165/Vivia-Turntable-for-Compact-Discs" title="">Behance page for Vivia. A Turntable for Compact Discs</a>.

Even though I own very few CDs now, I'd consider owning one of these if it ever came to fruition.
