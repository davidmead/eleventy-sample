I woke from a restless night. My left foot hurts. I can barely walk on.

It started snowing.

I hobble to-and-fro letting out the dogs, taking a shower, making breakfast.

It's been snowing pretty much all day.

I have half-written blog posts about <a href="https://roonlabs.com" title="music software">Roon</a>, gaming, and updating this blog. Two other projects; Collection of web development tenets, and my resume, need to be finished and uploaded.

Still snowing.

The three books I got for Xmas still sit, uncracked, on the shelf.

I post this. Is this something? Not really.
