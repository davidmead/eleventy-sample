As with e-mail I've hit the tipping point where I can't possible listen to all the podcasts I subscribe to.

I can only listen to "conversational" podcasts when I'm either driving or doing nothing. That doesn't amount to a lot of time.

## Daily time

During the day I'm either in meetings, or trying to get back into that '[flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))'. Neither of which let me drop in-and-out of narrative or conversation audio.

I do have some music podcasts which I'll keep for that time. [Monday Graveyard](https://www.sheeldz.co.uk/radio/blog/), [Ultima Thule](http://www.ultimathule.info/), [The Black Dog](https://www.theblackdogma.com/), and [Echoes](https://echoes.org/) are a few.  These range from ambient to electronic dance with a little conversation between mixes.

Ones I'm having to let go are the long form conversations.  Now that, I guess, podcasts are "a thing" the length and advertising have increased. They aren't bad, and I'll miss them, but that's the problem right now-I'm missing them.

## An ungodly amount

I currently have 58 episodes sitting in my queue. Most around 40-60 minutes in length. [John Gruber's 2hr 45m episode](https://pca.st/h5ovwmhi) will go unheard.

And they keeping piling in. Some have even ended and I haven't got around to hearing them all.  So I'm saying goodbye to:

*   [The Talk Show With John Gruber](daringfireball.net/thetalkshow)
*   [Off Camera with Sam Jones](http://offcamera.com)
*   [Design Everywhere](https://evergreenpodcasts.com/design-everywhere)
*   [Tanis](https://tanispodcast.com/) (great, but I don't know when it'll be back)
*   [The Last movie](http://www.publicradioalliance.com/the-last-movie)
*   [Rabbits](https://www.rabbitspodcast.com/)
*   [The Movies That Made Me](https://trailersfromhell.com/podcast)
*   [Long Now: Seminars About Long-term Thinking](http://longnow.org/)
*   [Eureka by Baron Fig](http://eureka.baronfig.com/)
*   [Invisibilia](https://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia)
*   [Soundtracking with Edith Bowman](https://audioboom.com/channel/soundtrackingwithedithbowman)
*   [CTRL+Click Cast](https://www.ctrlclickcast.com/)

I list them here in the hope I can pick them back up again. Who knows.

Now my list is down, and with the Xmas holidays coming up, I may actually catch up.
