As my commute is now walking downstairs to the basement I decided to cook breakfast, using the leftovers from last night. We had tostados, so the broken ones (held together by refried beans) made the base. Topped with an egg which I cooked along with the tomatoes &amp; chili's. Delicious with a big mug of black coffee.
