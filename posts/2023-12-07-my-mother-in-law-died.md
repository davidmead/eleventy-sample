Julie's mum died tonight. She got the call a few hours after leaving the hospital.

We'd all been sitting with Linda that day. Julie & Jamie having to talk about "making her comfortable" with the staff. It broke us all when Josh called to say his goodbyes. This was her second battle with cancer.

Linda was a wonderfully warm and caring person. Loved crafts, and was a great photographer.

Worked as an Executive Assistant for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaufmann's" title="Wikipedia entry">Kaufmann's</a>", May Company, and later Macy's. Always organized and a massive help to us. Even flew over to the UK with empty suitcases to help us move.

I always felt I could talk to her. She knew just the right present to give someone, and was a great support when she became a Grandmother.

She was a big part of my life.  My second mother. We will all miss her deeply.
