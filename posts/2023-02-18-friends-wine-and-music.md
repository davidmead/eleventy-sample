It'd been over a year since we last <a href="/posts/2021-12-11-babies-wineries-power-cuts/" title="Post from December 2021">met up at the wineries</a>, so it was great seeing some of the old gang again. Pity Tom P. and Adam couldn't make it.

This time we tried some different places. Starting at <a href="https://www.hundleycellars.com" title="">Hundley Cellars</a> I met up with Tom B., Linda, and her husband Chris.  Surprisingly this was the first time I'd met him.  Starting with a pleasant glass of Harvest Red we caught up, but had to sit pretty close to the live band. After a few songs, and a bowl of salt & vinegar almonds, we moved on.

Next stop was <a href="https://www.debonne.com" title="">Debonne Vineyards</a>. I opted for half a pint of the <a href="https://untappd.com/user/davidmead/checkin/1249201092" title="Untappd check-in">Red Ale by Double Wing Brewing</a>.  Once again there was live music, but this time nowhere to sit.

On to <a href="https://www.mcellars.com" title="">M Cellars</a> where I had a really nice glass of 2021 Noiret.  Music here was from a solo acoustic guitar. Laid back and very pleasant.

With the sun setting we made our last stop at <a href="https://www.stonegaitwinery.com" title="">Stonegait Winery</a>. Just water for me here. Joined by Jess (Tom's wife, and another ex-Optiem/Adcom alum) and two of their boys, we enjoyed the left-over almonds Linda brought from Hundley, and Cheeseburger Pizza.

It was <em>really</em> good reminiscing, hearing new stories from Chris of cycling trips to Trappist Breweries in Belgium and teaching in Utah, as well as getting to meet Tom's family.

Fingers crossed this becomes a yearly tradition.
