So far the earliest capture, I can find, of my blog in <a href="https://web.archive.org" title="an Internet archive">The Wayback Machine</a> is from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081013155751/http://www.davidjohnmead.com/2008_08_01_archive.html" title="capture of my homepage">2008</a>.

It's a nice snapshot of what I used 14 years ago.

Though a lot of the sites/companies mentioned there are long gone; ClaimID, Technorati, Flock, Miro, etc. The general design-pattern of blog post, and its underlying "tech", is still in use todayâ€”RSS, microformats, tagging, Twitter.

The great thing about the Internet Archive capture is seeing the actual markup I used. That way, if I can't find the back-up, I can copy & paste it here (which I'll probably do).
