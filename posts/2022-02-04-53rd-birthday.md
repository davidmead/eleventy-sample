Had some nice birthday messages, including one from an old school pal I haven't heard from in years.

Started the day shoveling snow. Still working remotely, but had some internet connection issues. Helped Josh finish clearing an old couples driveway. Grabbed my, now traditional, Chinese takeout for dinner followed by a slice (or two) of Lemon Meringue pie.

Julie outdid herself with presents. Though I've been enjoying the X-Box Series X for a while now, she also got me a new pair of <a href="https://huckberry.com/store/astorflex/category/p/69205-softflex" title="Huckberry shop page">Astorflex leather sneakers</a> and two t-shirts by <a href="https://huckberry.com/forty-five" title="Products page">Forty Five</a>. All from one of my favourite online stores, <a href="https://huckberry.com/" title="">Huckberry</a>.
