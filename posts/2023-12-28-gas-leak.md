Around 6pm there was a bang on our front door.  It was the postman. Yelling above the dogs going mental, he told me he could smell gas out front.

I went to check and yes, I could smell something.

I called the emergency number. Within 30 minutes someone from Dominion was here and confirmed there was a leak on the service line.

Around 8pm a truck turned up with digging equipment. Luckily they only had to replace the line near the meter. An hour-or-so later we're back up and running. Leak fixed and heating restored.

I hate to think what could've have happened.

Tomorrow I'm going to get the postman a little thank you :-)
