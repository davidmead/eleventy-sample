Here it is. His eighteenth year. Hard to believe.

It really does feel like last week I was building LEGO with him on the floor of his room. Carrying him up the stairs, splashing around at <a href="https://www.greatwolf.com/sandusky" title="">Great Wolf Lodge</a>, or taking him <a href="https://flic.kr/p/cxmHdu" title="photo on Flickr">camping for the first time</a>.

Now he's driving around, paying taxes, and looking to college.

We are both incredibly proud of the compassionate and smart human he's become.

Love you buddy.
