Weather and mood getting grayer by the day as we head into the clutches of Winter.

This [report of a mysterious metal monolith](https://futurism.com/the-byte/scientists-discover-mysterious-metal-monolith-wilderness?mc_eid=32992e9027&mc_cid=0c5ed0380b "article from The Futurist") spotted by scientist in a helicopter, brightened my day.  An art piece maybe? Practical joke or left-overs of a photo shoot?

The Braille Institute has released (for free) [Atkinson Hyperlegible font](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont) aimed at "Improve legibility and readability for low vision readers". I may try it out on this blog for a while.

Chatting at work we lamented the rise of the overtly boxy design thats crept in as defacto for websites currently. I have fond memories of waiting for sites like [The Urban Diary](https://web.archive.org/web/19970212183913/http://gertrude.art.uiuc.edu/ludgate/the/place/urban_diary/index.html "captured at the Web Archive") to slowly load via my modem. Never knowing what I'd find had a certain appeal.

Thoroughly enjoyed watching '23 Frames: A visual journey through the work of Edgar Wright' (via Vimeo) as part of the [2020 Belfast Film Festival](https://belfastfilmfestival.org). I could listen to these two talk about film for hours.

I was supposed to be playing [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net "official website"), but it got delayed yet again.
