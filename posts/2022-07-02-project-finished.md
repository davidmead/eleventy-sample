This week marks the official end of a (huge) project at work.

We're out of hypercare. The service implementor has rolled off, and our (fantastic) Project Manager has retired.

It also marks <strong>20 months</strong> of me doing very little of what I was hired to do.

During this project I've worn the hats of 'Interim Team Manager', 'QA Tester', and 'Front-end Developer' to name a few. I've tracked down & entered invoices, been on numerous 2AM deploys, lead meetings, and had to make lots of non-UX related decisions.  All of this working remotely thanks to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

I am the only remaining member of the original team (Hi <a href="https://ctmiller.net" title="" rel="met friend">Chris<a/>, Shannon, and Brad ðŸ‘‹) who got the quotes at the start.

It's been stressful, frustrating, and disheartening at times. But, as "they" say, <q>the only way out is through</q>.  We've had some laughs too, the new team rallying together under pressure.

But even though we have a litany of problems still to fix (and finding new ones daily), it does seem I can start getting back to the user experience and all that entails.
