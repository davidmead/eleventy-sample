I've been saving up my pennies and grabbed some new (and old) albums from <a href="https://bandcamp.com/davidmead/wishlist" title="Bandcamp">my wishlist</a>.

## Ambient

<a href="https://ambientelectronic.bandcamp.com/album/35-free-ambient-electronic-sampler" title="">Free ambient electronic sampler 35</a>—As the name suggests a free sampler from the excellent Spotted Peccary label, though I always pay something for these.

<a href="https://astralindustries.bandcamp.com/album/ai-35-ghost-lights" title="">AI-35: Ghost Lights</a>—New album from Rod Modell. This mixes subtle environmental recordings with huge soundscapes that you'd expect from Modell.  A return to the territory of one my personal faves, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/294662-Roderick-Julian-Modell-The-Autonomous-Music-Project" title="Discogs entry">The Autonomous Music Project</a> maybe? I have to sit with it more to tell.

<a href="https://sitenonsite.bandcamp.com/album/tokyo-ep" title="">Tokyo EP</a>—This is a pre-order of the final part of the Japan series from <a href="https://colly.com" title="personal site">Simon Collison</a>. Looking forward to hearing this soon.

## Electronic / Dance

<a href="https://simianmobiledisco.bandcamp.com/album/murmurations" title="">Murmurations</a>—Released in 2018 from Simian Mobile Disco feels more like a <a href="https://www.bellaunion.com/artist-page/deep-throat-choir" title="">Deep Throat Choir</a> album, with SMD providing backup. Really enjoyable big vocal dance tracks in there.

<a href="https://soulwax.bandcamp.com/album/from-deewee" title="">From DEEWEE</a>—Another great Soulwax album, this time from 2017. Recorded in one continuous live take. Full of stonking big tracks that demand to be played loud! Could probably fall under indie rock with the 3 live drummers, etc.

<a href="https://aboveboardprojects.bandcamp.com/album/no-photos-on-the-dancefloor" title="">No Photos On The Dancefloor</a>—Another album I found via <a href="https://darko.audio" title="audiophile reviews">John Darko</a>. 20 tracks charting Berlin techno from 1992–2021.

<a href="https://moderncathedrals.bandcamp.com/album/stained-glass" title="">Stained Glass</a>—A 5 track deep techno offering from cv313, who are Steve Hitchell & Rod Modell (again). Found via the, now shelved, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DubMonitor/videos" title="YouTube">Dub Monitor</a> channel.
