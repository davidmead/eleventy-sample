Doing my usual Sunday catch-up of RSS feeds.

I've read <a href="https://om.co" title="">Om Malik</a> for years, so when <a href="https://om.co/2022/10/02/october-2022-a-personal-update-some-good-reads/" title="Om's blog post">he referenced</a> a <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/09/have-i-reached-the-douglas-adams-inflection-point-or-is-modern-tech-just-a-bit-rubbish/" title="">Terence Eden post</a> I had one of those "Oh, huh" moments.

You see I'd just read Terence's post and it resonated with me. It also seems to have done the same with Om (he also left a comment).

For some reason it took me by surprise that Om would read the same blogs I do. I can't say why, it just did.

I also love that, through blogs, there's still a sense of a wider connection and community.

The part that hit us both? <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Salmon_of_Doubt/xU3m_s5O7yMC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;bsq=normal%20and%20ordinary" title="">Douglas Adams thought on technology</a>...

<ul>
<li>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li>
<li>Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</li>
<li>Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</li>
</ul>

I think I've reached the same inflection point.  It's the hype surrounding the tech that kills a lot of it for me too.
