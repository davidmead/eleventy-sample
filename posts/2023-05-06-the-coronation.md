Today was The Coronation of King Charles III.

I didn't wake up early for it, though did lend my Union Jack to Rena who watched it live.

I caught up with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nWmPw8dok3Q?feature=share" title="">BBC's live stream on YouTube</a>. It captured all the pomp and ceremony.

Certainly hit me in the "the feels" when <a href="https://youtu.be/MiXgOQ9_-RI" title="YouTube video">Zadok the Priest</a> (Handel's Coronation Anthem No. 1) started during the anointing. Was a favourite piece of music for my Dad.

This is the first coronation to happen in my lifetime.  Though I have seen footage of Queen Elizabeth's, I didn't remember how much moving around there was. Lots of undressing, dressing, changing chairs. This "dance" choreographed over hundreds of years.

I spoke to my sister later in the day. She'd caught most of it on TV. Tomorrow there is a street party happening. Hopefully the rain will hold off for them. I wonder if there'll be <a href="https://www.royal.uk/the-coronation-quiche" title="Official recipe">Coronation Quiche"</a>?
