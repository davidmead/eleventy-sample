Great news from <a href="http://larryhalff.com/" title="" rel="met colleague">Larry</a> and the gang over at Ma.gnolia.

Today at Gnomedex they <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/blog/2008/08/22/the-open-road-ahead" title="">announced M2</a>, a project to completely re-write ma.gnolia from the ground up and making it an open source project which means it "can be downloaded to remix and run as your own".

Ma.gnolia has been the keeper of <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/people/DaveMead/bookmarks" rel="me" title="">my social bookmarks</a> for sometime now, and I had the opportunity meet <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidmead/2332650611/" title="photo on Flickr">Larry and Todd at SXSW</a> last year.

I'm excited about this because they have always had an eye to what's happening on the web (OpenID etc.) and being one of the first responders.
