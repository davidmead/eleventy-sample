'Show is on a break or finished' is a message I'm seeing more & more in my <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com" title="Pocket Casts">podcast player</a>.

Long-standing favourites seem to disappear after moving to a <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo" title="Indieweb wiki entry">silo</a>. YouTube, Mixcloud, Spotify, etc.

I guess Dave Winer summed it up best...

<figure class="blockquote">
    <blockquote cite="http://scripting.com/2022/02/03.html#a231956">
        <p>If, at the end of your show you say "Available where you get podcasts," then my friend, you have a podcast. If you have to say "Only available on Spotify" (or some other exclusive service), good for you, but it's not a podcast.</p>

Here's some I miss.

## The Monday Graveyard

A <a href="https://twitter.com/mondaygraveyard/status/1466533030651174922" title="">tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/mondaygraveyard" title="Twitter profile">@mondaygraveyard</a> stated <q>the final episode is out now</q> on Dec 2, 2021

I had to search for it as the website no longer loads, and Mark had moved his podcast to MixCloud in 2020. It's a shame, but understandable.

On the last episode he says he doesn't have copies of the old shows himself as his cloud storage was full. I have to assume as he didn't do sponsors the time & money to self-host was too much.

I couldn't run the last episode back to get his exact quote because scrubbing/replaying is reserved for 'Mixcloud Select' subscribers apparently.

You can <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/sheeldz/monday-graveyard-show-215-02122021/" title="Mixcloud page for episode 215 of The Monday Graveyard">listen to the last episode</a> on Mixcloud.

## Kahvi Collective Podcast

The net label <a href="http://www.kahvi.org" title="">Kahvi</a> has been around for ages and release a ton of great material. They too have a Mixcloud account, but it's for listening to the releases.  I haven't seen a podcast episode since May 2019.

## Ultima Thule Ambient Music

These are recordings of the <a href="http://www.ultimathule.info" title="homepage">weekly radio program</a>, another long-standing favorite. They too moved over to Mixcloud, but did retroactively update their podcast feed. The last one I saw in Pocket Casts was from July 2021. Same for Mixcloud.

I'm wondering if the radio program no longer airs.
