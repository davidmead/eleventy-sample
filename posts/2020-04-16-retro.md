A day without interviews.

Found out my last paycheck <strong>won't</strong> include the severance money. Instead will only be for 3 days worked and any accrued vacation days. Severance not coming until May 1st.

Having no health insurance kinda sucks
- Paid $400+ for medicine to prevent blood clots
- Paid $600+ as a <abbr title="Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act">COBRA</abbr> payment to [reinstate coverage for a month](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/what-is-cobra-insurance "article on what COBRA is") (next month it's $2000+) so we can claim some of that back.
- When I get another job it'll be another 30 odd days before I'm covered by that company plan.

I miss [the NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/ "National Health Service website").

With neither of us employed, and no unemployment payments being processed, I applied on [Healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) to see if we can get coverage there.

Also had to buy a new fridge/freezer as our decided to break down this week.

By the way. Did I mention there's a pandemic going on too?
