Is was the 90's and I was just hearing about this whole Internet thingy. I worked on an industrial estate at the end of the Fenchurch Street (train) line in Essex. We still had a computer that took 5Â¼" floppy disks and the new Windows machine was solely for the Director.

My knowledge of "the net" came from <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/" title="">William Gibson</a>, <a href="http://www.netmag.co.uk/" title="">.NET Magazine</a> and a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-Reality-Revolutionary-Technology-Computer-Generated/dp/0671778978/ref=pd_bbs_sr_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219544922&amp;sr=8-4">Virtual Reality by Howard Rheingold</a>. Mr. Rheingold's book become something I read, and shared with friends.&nbsp; This was what <em>was</em> going to happen!&nbsp; It was filled with descriptions of old arcade games that emulated motorcycle rides through to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics">teledildonics</a>.

After getting a PC and connecting to "the net" (which really was more frustration than excitement at the start) things didn't quite pan out the way I foresaw them.

I looked for that book recently, just to re-visit some of the ideas, but found it was one I left behind when we moved to the US. But as chance would have it I ended up connecting with Mr. Rheingold (virtually) the very next day. As I fired up <a href="http://www.getmiro.com/" title="">Miro</a>, there he was A featured channel - <a href="http://vlog.rheingold.com/" title="">vlogging about the social media classroom</a>.

I recommend subscribing through Miro or the RSS feed to see why he's starting this classroom and the tools he's included in it.
