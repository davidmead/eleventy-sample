Tonight I enjoyed a night out with my co-workers. Guests of our new (again) technical partner, we dined at <a href="http://www.johnnysonfulton.com" title="">Johnny's Bar</a> on Fulton Road.

It's been around since the 1920's. A real "old school" vibe.  We sat on the patio courtyard, enjoyed some drinks, had some great food.

One '<a href="https://www.themanual.com/food-and-drink/how-to-make-an-old-fashioned/" title="recipe for this whiskey cocktail">old fashioned</a>' lasted me the whole evening. Sautéed Stuffed Calamari, salad, followed by <a href="/posts/2022-08-16-filet-beef-au-poivre/" title="">Filet of Beef au Poivre with Green Peppercorn, Sherry, Cognac & Demi Glacé</a> filled me up—Delicious.

A nice moment to relax. A pause between the last 20 months of a stressful website re-platform, and the next 4 months headlong race to 2023.
