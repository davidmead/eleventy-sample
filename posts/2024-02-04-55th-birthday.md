Still here. Collected a few more aches, pains, and wrinkles along the way.

Bacon sandwich for breakfast, while <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/davidmead" title="Twitch">streaming a couple of hours of Destiny 2</a>. Quite a few birthday texts, and well wishes.

Another great score on the presents front. Looking forward to diving into the <a href="http://www.simonstalenhag.se" title="">Simon St√•lenhag</a> book, along with those Turkish Delights and an <a href="https://www.greeneking.co.uk/our-beers/old-speckled-hen/old-speckled-hen" title="">Old Speckled Hen</a> tonight.

New to me is the '<a href="https://susherevans.com/drinks-us-var01/" title="">Drinks & Sinkholes</a>' book. Described as <q cite="https://susherevans.com/drinks-us-var01/">Warm beds, quaint mysteries, and the best rosemary bread this side of Pigsend Creek</q>. Sounds just what I need.
