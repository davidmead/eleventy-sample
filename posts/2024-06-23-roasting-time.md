I travelled to deepest, darkest Medina today. <a href="https://ctmiller.net" title="" rel="friend met">Chris</a> had offered to show me how he roasts coffee.

After some homemade Chicken Paprikash as a spot of lunch, Chris set to work. I had chipped in towards some green coffee beans from <a href="https://www.sweetmarias.com" title="Home coffee roasting supplier">Sweet Marias</a>. This batch was "Costa Rica Dry Process Santa Cruz".

Described on the bag as <q title="">Fruits at the front of the cup, with a rustic bittersweetness base note. Blueberry, and red raspberry come through at City+, and flavors of fermented fruits bring an acetic aspect to the cup, like blackberry wine. City+ to Full City+</q>.

<h2>Dark roast</h2>
He suggested we try 2 different approaches. First up a dark roast.

Measuring out about a half pound of beans, he placed them in the drum and set the roaster in motion.

After a while I got to experience "first crack". A slow popping as the beans started to split. Adjusting the timer we then sat and listened for "second crack". The was certainly different from the firstâ€“Faster and higher. When that started the roaster was set to cool down.

When the beans came out they were dark and had a slightly oily look to them. They smelt great! A lot of chaff was left behind.

<h2>Light roast</h2>
Next up was the lighter roast. Similar steps as the first but this time, shortly after "first crack" the roaster was set to cool down. No second crack for this batch.

They came out decidedly lighter, with less chaff being left behind.  These too smelt great.

After bagging up we enjoyed a cup of the light roast. It lived up to the notes with a fruity body.

A fun time of chatting, catching up, setting the world to rights, and (for me) learning about roasting coffee.

Thanks Chris.
