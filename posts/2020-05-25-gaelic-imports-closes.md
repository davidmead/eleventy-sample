This is sad. It is never good when small niche businesses go, but I do have selfish reasons too.

Even after passing on to new owners 4 years ago, they made some of <strong>the best</strong> sausage rolls and pies I've had. Here, or back in the UK. They were also about the only place to obtain certain imported goods from home.
