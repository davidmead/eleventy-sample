Up and at 'em early today. Swing by Biagio's to grab coffee and a half dozen donuts. Then it's off to Medina.  I'm attending <a href="https://ctmiller.net" title="Chris Miller">Chris</a>'s second 'Game Gather' weekend.

Along with some of the usual faces from Game Night, I finally met <a href="https://vandermore.com" title="">David Moore</a> face-to-face, which was nice as he'd travelled in from out-of-State.

After some catching up we started the day with a couple rounds of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cheapassgames/get-lucky-the-kill-doctor-lucky-card-game" title="Kickstarter page">Get Lucky</a>, the Kill Doctor Lucky Card Game. A fun deck-building game, which was pretty easy to pick up.

Rachel also brought quick game called Poison (I think?), where you had to wager against the other players in matching tokens with dice rolls. A quick coffee break and then it's on to the big games.

## Vampire: The Masquerade – Vendetta
I've <a href="/posts/2021-07-06-game-night-vendetta/" title="post from 2021">played this before</a> and always enjoy it. Using the same archetypes from White Wolf's <abbr title="Role playing game">RPG</abbr> (which I used to play & run back in the UK), you play as one of the many vampire clans in Chicago. Plotting, and battling to acquire control of the city.

Halfway through we broke for lunch.

## Cthulhu: Death May Die
Next up was <a href="https://cmon.com/product/cthulhu-death-may-die/cthulhu-death-may-die" title="">Cthulhu: Death May Die</a>.  I'd never played this before–It was a lot of fun.  With the usual Lovecraftian stakes of death, madness, or both, this is a co-operative game where we make our way around the "board" trying to stay alive and destroy certain items before the "big bad" is summoned.

The Elder God was summoned and it was touch-and-go, but thanks to a self-sacrifice from David, we beat it!

## Calling it
This week has felt particularly long, so when it got to 8pm I called it a night.  Chris & Cat were  great hosts. I had a lot of fun playing new games, catching up, and relaxing for a while.  Here's to next years Game Gather.
