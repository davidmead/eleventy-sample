A staple British food, the sausage roll can be found almost everywhere. Bakers, supermarkets, petrol (gas) stations. Delicious hot or cold.

With everything going on this year I haven't had any. The nearest British specialty shop, Gaelic Imports, [closed down](https://davidjohnmead.com/posts/2020-05-25-gaelic-imports-closes/ "my post about it") so I decided to have a go myself.

A big hurdle is the sausage. British sausage isn't like the ones over here so I fabricated my own. Adding fresh sage and some cooked diced onions to the minced pork, along with a spoonful of breadcrumbs. Not brave enough to attempt the pastry I grabbed some Pepperidge Farms pre-made puff pastry.

Assembled and cooked at 400&deg; for about 30 mins and they turned out <strong>awesome!</strong>

It made enough for two large ones and several small ones.  Josh &amp; I split the big ones for the last two nights dinner. I froze the smaller ones to have at Xmas.

I used a couple of videos as guides - [Food Busker](https://youtu.be/rXIrnyitnqM) and [River Cottage](https://youtu.be/oKWNqzG0kko). The latter I'll use to try making my own pastry next time.
