I've sat down a few times to <a href="/posts/2023-01-22-i-should-do-something" title="">capture this</a>, to no avail. Sometimes long-winded, sometimes a bulleted list. But today's the day.

So here goes.

## History
I had built up a large collection of music over the years. Vinyl, cassette, CD, and mini-disk. Even some early MP3's.

Only the MP3's, CD's, and mini-disks made the trans-Atlantic move at the turn of the Century.

With the arrival of the iPod & iTunes all those CD's got ripped. Being sold off over the coming years.

That digital library moved from iTunes to <a href="/posts/2020-07-12-google-kills-play-music" title="">Google Play Music</a>, then to <a href="/posts/2020-11-28-iBroadcast" title="">iBroadcast</a>.

It was during the Pandemic, being at home during lock-downs, made me miss the ability to listen to my music "out loud".  It had been years since I owned a stereo system with speakers.

My main consumption was via headphones. Either through iPod, phone, or laptop. Only exception was whilst in the car.

## Trying things

Apple Music/iTunes had changed, a lot, since I'd used them last. I found it complicated and confusing, So I bought <a href="https://swinsian.com" title="">Swinsain</a>.

More reminiscent of the old old iTunes but with newer features.  It was faster, had some great tools like a duplicate finder, and still synched with my old iPods.

I added some <a href="https://www.apple.com/homepod-mini/" title="">Apple HomePod mini's</a> to the mix and this worked great for a while. I was still missing something though.

This was great when on my laptop or managing my library, but I wanted to listen when I was in the office or car.

I tried Plex but it didn't click with me. Then I heard about <a href="https://roon.app/en/" title="">Roon</a>, gave that a go, and got hooked. Roon gave me access to a whole world of extra information about what I was listening to.

As it pulls in album information from various sources, it'd surface connections between artists & albums. They also launched <a href="https://roon.app/en/arc" title="">Roon ARC</a> which streamed my files to my phone.

## Present setup
So there it is. All my purchased music stored locally, available in Roon, streamed through HomePod minis.

The difference is amazing.  Having the music fill a room makes all the difference.  I find myself actually sitting and listening more. Discovering and enjoying old albums like hearing them for the first time.

### Import flow
<ol>
<li>Buy & download (<code>.FLAC</code> if possible) from <a href="https://www.bandcamp.com" title="">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://www.beatport.com" title="">Beatport</a>, or the artists own site</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://amvidia.com/tag-editor" title="">Amvidia's Tag Editor</a> for filling in blanks in the files meta data</li>
<li>Then add to Swinsain which organizes them on the NAS</li>
<li>Roon then watches the NAS folders and pulls them in</li>
</ol>


## Future-Fi
John Darko coined the term, <a href="https://darko.audio/2023/05/what-is-future-fi-in-2023/" title="John's blog post">Future-Fi</a>, and it fits how I found myself listening to music now. Hardware with built-in ability to stream music, either through a service or your own files.

On the wishlist is a pair of <a href="https://www.crutchfield.com/p_991LSX2BK/KEF-LSX-II-Carbon-Black-Fabric.html" title="Crutchfield product page">Kef LSX II speakers</a>. An upgrade from the Apple HomePod minis that currently fill the living room.

<a href="https://roonlabs.com/r/i28vNJ7x306rR6vFmpHYRQ" title="">Roon offers a free 30-day trail</a>, if anyone wanted to give a go.
