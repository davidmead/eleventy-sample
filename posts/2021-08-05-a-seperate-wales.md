Andy Clarke had [an interesting post](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/thoughts-on-yescymru "thoughts on yescymru") on his blog about YesCymru's messaging.

Now. I am not Welsh, and haven't lived in the UK for over 20 years, so I have no dog in this race. But I'm positive becoming an independent country isn't a flip-of-the-switch thing.

Andy brings up some great points about "pushing the positives" and moving it more to having the "ability to grow".

I'm sure people involved will consider how breaking away from the NHS <em>could</em> have an impact on those stats.

Wales has seen it's [share of ups-and-downs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wales "Wikipedia entry"), and I think eyeing the future through the lens of growth is great. They could even re-join Europe!

Maybe it is time to break up the UK. See how Wales, Scotland, N.Ireland, and England fare.
