This year Vitamix celebrates its [centennial](https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/Corporate-Information/About-Us/Company-History "official timeline"). 100 years is a long time to be in business, especially as a family-owned one.

Part of the celebration was a big "thank you" get together at one of the manufacturing facilities. We had the give-aways, speeches, and awards. But being around that many people was both exciting, and unnerving.

I'm sure that'll pass the more we slip back into our post-Pandemic ways.
