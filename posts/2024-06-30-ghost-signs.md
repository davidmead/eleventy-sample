As I've mentioned before, <a href="/posts/2021-12-31-ghostsign-hunting/" title="">I love Ghost Signs</a>.

I've been capturing them around the Cleveland area for a while now. Adding them to Flickr, which has quite a lot under the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ghostsign" title="Tagged photos on Flickr">Ghost Sign</a> tag (I really should add mine to this site). Reading through this brought back a lot of memories.

Though this documents them in London, a lot of the same were in-and-around where I lived in Southend.

The authors do a fantastic job researching the history behind these echoes of the past. Diving into not only the products, but the companies and sign-writers responsible.

I also learned the term "palimpsest", describing the overpainting of multiple signs in one spot. Something I've seen in my own photos.

With chapters such as 'Building the City', 'Furnishing the City', and 'Dressing the City' they reveal a picture of everyday life an expanding metropolis.

If you have even a passing interest in sign writing, architecture, or urban history I think you'd like this book.

I throughly enjoyed picking it up and thumbing through over the months since it arrived.

The <a href="https://ghostsigns.co.uk" title="">accompanying website</a> has an interactive map, news of tours, and much more.
