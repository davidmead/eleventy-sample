It's just after 6.30am.  There's a storm rolling over us.

The sliding door is open and the sound of rain, thunder, and birds is mixing with <a href="https://somafm.com/dronezone/" title="online radio"> SomaFM Drone Zone</a> (playing Celestial by Starterra) perfectly. Like one of those relaxation mixes on YouTube.

Dogs are laying quietly. I'm sipping black coffee with honey.

What a lovely start to the day.
