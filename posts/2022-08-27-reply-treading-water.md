Thanks for articlutaing this Gregor.

I'm not alone all the time with my wife, son, and two dogs in the house. But over the past 2 years, sitting at my desk in the basement, it can certainley feel like that.

My work requires two days in the office.  The team I'm on is smallâ€”All vaccinated. For those days the building is pretty empty. But where I live in Ohio it has a yo-yoing COVID rate.  I still wear a mask in large crowds, but like you I now tend to avoid them.  I agree the response and guidance is lacking, as is the acceptance and understanding.

Cinema, meet-ups, happy-hours all gone by the wayside now.

I am lucky to have enjoy the occasional game night with friends (who share the same concerns) which refills that social battery for a while.

You're not alone. And it can, and will, get better.
