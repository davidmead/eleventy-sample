In his [latest post](https://werd.io/2021/alternatives-to-the-metaverse "Alternatives to the metaverse") Ben lays outs a couple of interesting alternative approaches to the 'metaverse', but his last paragraph brought it home. 

<figure class="blockquote">
    <blockquote cite="https://werd.io/2021/alternatives-to-the-metaverse">
        <p>The metaverse is a top-down, highly-financed commercial vision, which has partially gained popularity because its ill-defined nature allows everyone to pin their own imagination on it. We would all benefit from an alternative, bottom-up, collaborative vision that trades commerce for community.</p>
