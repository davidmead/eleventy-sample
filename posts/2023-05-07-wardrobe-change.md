This weekend saw the start of 立夏・Rikka, according to the <a href="https://smallseasons.guide" title="">Small Seasons Guide</a>.

So I figure this serves as good a reason as any to swap out to my Summer wardrobe.

To be clear I am in <em>no way</em> a "fashion horse" (cue Balenciaga vs. H&M meme). This is more swapping out my <a href="https://www.wigwam.com/products/el-pine-f2044?variant=42833076387971" title="WigWam El-Pine socks">heavy socks</a> and t-shirts with lighter weight ones. Away go the majority of long sleeved shirts, replaced with short sleeved.

A few items go in the donate pile thanks to my Winter-induced belly expansion. Hopefully this comes down a little so the same fate doesn't befall my favourite Summer shirts.

Over the years I've cultivated this habit, mainly due Ohio's swing between bitter Winters and searing Summers.
