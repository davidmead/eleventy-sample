I'm going through the accounts I follow on Twitter and Instagram, looking for URLs.

There aren't many. Hardly any list a website in the bio, even companies. When there is one, it's very rarely a blog.

A trend (for companies) is to use other third-party sites, like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/). Nothing more than a page with links to your other social presences, sales, etc.

You could do this on your own site, but I guess $6 a month to funnel your traffic through someone else's product solves a problem for some people.

Companies aside, when there is a site in people's bio some don't have RSS feeds. Some are years out-of-date. Some domains have expired.

It's a shame that everything is poured into these silos. That there's still a perceived barrier of complexity to having your own site.

When exporting my data from Twitter they start with the line...
<figure class="blockquote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>You can request a ZIP file with an archive of the data <strong>we think</strong> is most important to you.</p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>

(emphasis mine)

So I'm not going to get everything anymore. Another reason I'm searching for those links.
