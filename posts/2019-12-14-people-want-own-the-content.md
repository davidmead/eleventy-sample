There seems to be a fair amount of chatter recently about hosting your own content again. This is a good thing.

Nathan Curtis tweeted out about how Medium is now changing their policy, and how it effects him...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So, <a href="https://twitter.com/Medium?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@medium</a> has done it? Only one free article per user even for authors that don&#39;t want a paywall? Glad <a href="https://twitter.com/eightshapes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@eightshapes</a> has setup and partially migrated to our .com too. I know what I&#39;m getting done by 1/1/2020. 😠 Too sad.</p>&mdash; Nathan Curtis (@nathanacurtis) <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/1204889629276676096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Laura Kalbag wrote [It’s Time to Get Personal](https://24ways.org/2019/its-time-to-get-personal/ "article on 24 ways") where she looks at the wasteland of personal websites, that could start to become a lush community garden of shared thoughts.

Even Jack Dorsey tweeted out that they are funding a team to develop something "new"...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard. 🧵</p>&mdash; jack 🌍🌏🌎 (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

...which of course led to a load of replies pointing out the already abundant ideas already in place on the web including Indieweb, ActivityPub, etc. Naturally blockchain got thrown around a lot too.

A great read was Anil Dash's [“Link In Bio” is a slow knife](https://anildash.com/2019/12/10/link-in-bio-is-how-they-tried-to-kill-the-web/ "post on his website") where he lays out how Instagram (and other silo's) keep people in the walled garden by limiting the access to external content.

Maybe 2020 will see the rise of something federated and syndicated, yet personal.
