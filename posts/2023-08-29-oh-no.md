It was only Sunday that I <a href="/posts/2023-08-27-listen-vegas-dust/" title="">posted about a new ambient album</a> where I said it'd make a nice companion to the music of The Stars of the Lid.

Then yesterday I saw <a href="https://hicks.design/journal/brian-mcbride-1970-2023" title="">Jon Hicks post</a> about the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwdDLnWtCO-/" title="official instagram post">sudden death of Brian McBride</a>, one half of <abbr title="Stars of the Lid">SOTL</abbr>, that weekend.

Like Jon, I <strong>loved</strong> their music. Always held out hope that they'd make another album.

My favourite album is 'The Tired Sounds of'.

I'm going to take Jon's advice and grab McBride's '<a href="https://starsofthelid.bandcamp.com/album/the-effective-disconnect" title="Bandcamp page">The Effective Disconnect</a>' off my Bandcamp wishlist.

R.I.P.
