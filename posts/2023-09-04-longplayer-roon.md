I've been using <a href="https://roon.app/en/" title="a platform for all the music in your home">Roon</a> to listen to all my music for sometime now.

Today I found I could set up the <a href="https://longplayer.org" title="Official site">Longplayer</a> live stream as a Roon Radio Station.

<ul>
	<li>Open the app</li>
	<li>Choose 'My Live Radio' from the menu</li>
	<li>Click/Touch '+ Add Station'</li>
	<li>Manually add station by pasting in the stream URL - http://icecast.spc.org:8000/longplayer</li>
	<li>Complete the name, icon, and description (optional)</li>
</ul>

Now I can stream the "one thousand year long musical composition" while I drift off to sleep.
