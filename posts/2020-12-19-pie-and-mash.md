Pie & Mash is a very British food. A very London thing.

It's been hardly changed since Victorian times. A meat pie, scoop of mashed potatoes, covered in a greenish gravy called "Liquor".

It is, in a word, <strong>delicious</strong>.

Now I've never lived in London, but I did work there as well as a regular visitor. It was only a 40 minute train ride away after all.

Where I did live (Southend-on-Sea) was at the end of two major train lines coming out of London. East Enders used to come down for weekends and the Pie & Mash shops came to cater for them.

Skip forward to the 70's-80's and most had disappeared along with the holiday makers, but a few remained. I have fond memories of sitting in those establishments. Steamed-up windows a barrier from the wet and cold outside, tucking into a hot meal amid the noise bouncing off the tiled walls.

[Jake Green](https://jake.green "official site") is a photographer who captured the history in his ['Pie & Mash London'](https://jake.green/?project=pie-mash "") project.

He created a short film, book, and held a [live event on YouTube](https://youtu.be/isQ6vQ8QoeU "watch recording") this past Sunday. The pictures in this post come from that event.

Guests included Matt Johnson ([The The](https://www.thethe.com "official site")) and John Rogers ([The Lost Byway](http://thelostbyway.com "John's videos and walks around London")).  Talking about the memories, and love, of this food and the shops that served it.

It was great to sit and listen to a reading of ['For the love of Pie & Mash'](https://spitalfieldslife.com/2018/12/23/jake-greens-pie-mash-shops/ "") by The Gentle Author. Watch the accompanying film to Jake's photos. Hear from the owners of shops still running. Live Q&amp;A afterwards.

A very enjoyable event that made me nostalgic, and hungry.
