10 days left to snag this deal on Humble Bundle. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/cerebus-dave-sim-books" title="">Cerebus. Complete collection of Dave Sim books</a>.

I used to own the large soft covers of these. From 'Cerebus' through to 'Guys'. Had to order them in special sometimes from the comic shop in Southend during the 90's.

No-brainer to grab this and finish off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Sim" title="Wikipedia entry">Dave Sim</a>'s massive, self-published, work.
