We had a 'computer lab' at my Secondary School, but the first computer we had at home was a [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum "Wikipedia entry").

I remember sitting with my Dad, re-typing programs on the rubber keys from newsprint magazines, and watching the fruits of our work on the TV.

<pre>
<code>
10 PRINT "Hello World"
20 GOTO 10
</code>
</pre>

By the end I had a huge library of games on cassette tape; The Hobbit, Manic Miner, anything from [Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Play_the_Game "Wikipedia entry about games maker").


The BBC has a nice [2013 video clip with Sir Clive](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58587521 "") where he states he doesn't use a computer as its <q>too distracting</q>.

Having this affordable computer changed my life. Thanks Sir Clive.
