With on/off rain and a chill in the air, this year's Thanksgiving was a quiet affair.

Still aware of COVID-19, and relatives recovering from chemotherapy, means we are on our own today.

Had a lie in and played a little Destiny 2 in the morning, with an eye on the work Slack channel in case anything stopped working.

## Eating

Coffee and a light Breakfast, skipped Lunch, and had a huge cooked Dinner:

* Roast chicken breasts
* Sweet potato casserole
* Roast potatoes (came out great)
* Roast carrots
* Yorkshire puddings (not great, need more practice)
* Stuffing
* Gravy
* Cranberry jelly
* Crescent rolls

Overall I was very happy with how it turned out. And the three of us eating together.

## Relaxing
Spent the early evening catching up on RSS feeds, listening to the [Hypnogogue podcast](https://hypnagoguepodcast.com "official site"), and eating some cheesecake.

I also spent a little time going through [Evernote](https://evernote.com "note taking app"), looking for draft posts. Found quite a few. Going to try and finish a couple before the years out.
