We have to have a specific Covid-19 test performed before Josh and I can return to the USA.

It can’t be performed more than a day before we travel. Nowhere can perform it near us, so we either spend a whole day traveling to get it done or get it delivered and do it with a Telehealth video call. But the delivery could be 48 hours. And we schedule the video call separately. 

This feels completely performative.

We’re trying the delivery/Telehealth option. All fingers are crossed.
