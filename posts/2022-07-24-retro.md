One of my favourite comic writers, <a href="https://2000ad.com/news/alan-grant-1949-2022/" title="POst on 2000AD website">Alan Grant, died</a>.

Judging from this quote, another of my favourite <a href="https://buttondown.email/orbitaloperations/archive/orbital-operations-24-july-2022-2209/" title="Warren Ellis newsletter">comic writers is turning into Percy Thrower</a>.

Catching up with, and enjoying, episodes of the <a href="http://www.ultimathule.info" title="official website">Ultima Thule podcast</a>.

Last week I could hardly walk on my right leg. The pain from driving made me feel sick.  Resting, icing, and stretching is making feel better. But my ankle is still puffy. Thought it was Plantar fasciitis, but looks more like Achilles tendinitis.

I managed to finish the latest Destiny 2 triumph for <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/SeasonOfTheHaunted#Solstice" title="official Bungie website">Solstice</a> <em>and</em> get the title.
