Back in 2022 I had the last of <a href="/posts/2022-01-07-last-wisdom-tooth/" title="">my wisdom teeth taken out</a>. It was...stressful to say the least, though no fault of the dentist.

This time it was my #18 tooth. It had a crown on it, but had cracked and was not repairable.

So back to <a href="https://www.alperin-fried.com/meet-us/dr-matthew-popper/" title="Oral surgery website">Dr. Popper</a>, but this time (thanks to his suggestion last visit) I was going under (sedation).

On Friday the crown suddenly popped off. Luckily my appointment was on Monday, and they had a cancellation, so I was the first to be seen.

I'm happy to report the rest was uneventful. As soon as I went out, I woke up and it was over.

Of course I was sore and taking antibiotics & Advil for the next week, but in the grand scheme of thingsâ€”One The best dental experience I think I've ever had.
