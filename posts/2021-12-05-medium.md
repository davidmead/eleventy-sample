I had totally forgotten again, that I had syndicated blog posts to [Medium](https://medium.com/@davidmead "My account page"). This was from my old Wordpress site.

I've already moved [one of those posts](/posts/2017-02-26-happy-40th-2000ad/ "Happy 40th 2000AD") back on to this site. I only have 8 posts there, so it makes sense I move the rest.

Medium claims I have 291 followers there. Haven't looked but almost all must be from when I linked it up with Twitter. Back when everyone jumped on the latest "bright & shiny".

Look for some new posts, dating back to 2015, to appear here shortly.
