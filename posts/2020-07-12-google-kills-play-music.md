So I got the dreaded email. Google is officially shutting down Play Music.

Opening line is “Starting today, you can finally enjoy your music on YouTube Music”. Finally? I wasn’t aware that I, or anyone really, was waiting for this.

The death knell comes in the opening paragraph, where they talk about [transferring your library](https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9698084?p=gpm_transfer&visit_id=637301787710178298-334405885&rd=1 "Google support article").

<figure class="blockquote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>YouTube Music will eventually replace Google Play Music later this year</p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>

So without much choice I started the process.  And while they acknowledge it “looks a bit different’ we now know why Play Music hasn’t seen any updates or improvements.
<figure class="blockquote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>YouTube Music “was built by the same team with the same passion</p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>

This seems a 100% algorithm-based streaming service. Something I am not remotely interested in.

Good job I dug out my iPod.
