Now I'm fully vaccinated, along with (currently) [over 40% of the adult USA population](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations "CDC Covid-19 data tracker"), it seemed like a good to spend money on going to see a couple of concerts.

Now I'm hedging my bets here.

We've had the CDC [update it's mask guidance for the fully vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html "") to <q cite="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html">resume activities without wearing masks or physically distancing...</q>, and there's another 4 months until the first one, so we should be good.

Also, if the last year has beaten anything into us, time is short.

## October

First concert is [Dead Can Dance](https://www.deadcandance.com/ "official site"), in Akron.  That's about an hour drive, so not that far.

I've been a fan since the 90's. I had a PenPal and we exchanged tapes of our favourite tracks. She'd included some DCD and I was hooked.

I missed out on seeing them in the UK over the years, so what better time than now.

## November

The second concert is [Genesis](https://www.genesis-music.com "official site") who will be playing Cleveland.

I last saw them live back in 1987, at Wembley Stadium, on the Invisible Touch tour.  It was Summer, I was 18, and it was fantastic!

Now I'm taking my 17 year old son to clap, stomp, and sing-along.
