Yes. I do drink tea.

My bag of choice is PG Tips, if I can get it. Splash of milk, tea bag, boiling (filtered) water, in that order. Let steep for about 4 mins or so, stir, and remove the bag.

Any cup will do, though my favourite is a large white cup. I've had it over 30 years now, bequeathed to me by an old co-worker. It used to have a blue & gold floral design on itâ€”That has since been washed away.
