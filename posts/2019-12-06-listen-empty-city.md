I can't remember when I first heard [Tor Lundvall](http://torlundvall.com/ "official site")'s work, but I've now got 3 of his albums I tend to play back-to-back. Out of the 3, [Empty City](https://torlundvall.bandcamp.com/album/empty-city "Buy it on Bandcamp") is my favourite.

It's the kind of ambient music that mixes big spaces with intimate voices to create a definite mood. And it's equally great played in any season. It changes slightly if listening in Winter or Summer, but fits both.

Some of his later albums have a mix of instrumental and lyrical tracks.

Definitely worth checking out.
