I've been reading James A. Reeves blog, Atlas Minor, for sometime now. He did a post a day in 2020, now collected as <a href="https://atlasminor.com/tag/notes-from-the-end-of-a-world/" title="">Notes from the end of a world</a> which I enjoyed.

Moving from New York to Nevada was also captured on the blog, and now he's released this album. Maybe a companion piece to the journey?

From the liner notes

	<blockquote cite="https://atlasminor.bandcamp.com/album/vegas-dust">
		<p>A few minutes after midnight in the Mojave desert, a preacher appears on a dead radio channel: “The devil’s job is to deceive you. The devil’s job is to make you think that God can’t do nothin’ for you, that God don’t care about you.”</p>

There is a definite sense of driving at night. Shapes looming up, then receding, in your headlights. Standing under the bright fluorescence of a gas station, peering into the dark.

Snippets from AM radio shows weave in-and-out of the slowly evolving atmospheres. Everything covered in a grainy crackle.

I've had this on heavy rotation the past couple of days.

Would make a great companion to some Stars of the Lid.
