I decided to treat myself to something different for lunch. Jamaican food from [Ela's Caribbean Grill](https://elas-caribbean-grill-restaurant.business.site). This was the Jerk Chicken with red beans & rice, and cabbage.  It was the "mild" version, so it had a nice kick but not too spicy. Chased it with some strong Ginger beer.

The chicken was nice and succulent. Large amount of rice. All-in-all a great lunch. I'll certainly be back to try some of the other dishes.
