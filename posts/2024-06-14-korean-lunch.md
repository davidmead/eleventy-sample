As an extension of our <a href="/tags/wednesday-nom-club/" title="posts tagged">#wednesday-nom-club</a> at work, a couple of us decided to branch out and go downtown for lunch on Friday. As it had been Brooke's birthday, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglle5x8pgdo" title="BBC article">her favourite BTS member had just finished National Service</a>, the choice was obviouslyâ€”Korean.

<a href="https://miegakorean.com" title="">Miega Korean Barbecue</a> has great lunch options, so we all met there.

The lunch bento boxes are packed. I opted for the Bulgogi, which was delicious. We also got a vegetable Pa Jun (Korean style pancake with spring onions) and Dduck Bok Ee (Stir-fried rice cake with spicy pepper paste) to share.

Brooke had brought a few flavours of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soju" title="Wikipedia entry">Soju</a> for us to try as well. Grape, and Mango, from Soon Hari as well as a bottle of Chum Churum Original (I think).

All <em>very good</em>, but a little dangerous for day-drinking.

Needless to say we couldn't finish everything. I ended up taking home the remaining Pa Jun with my leftovers.

What a fun time. Hope we can all do it again soon.
