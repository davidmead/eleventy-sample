I was in a meeting today, about keywords.

One attendee had an Excel sheet where they listed certain words, grouped under a headings. We all chimed in about where, and when, they could & should be used. What would need updating. What's missing. The potential impact these would have.

Maybe they didn't realize it, but we were talking about ontologies, taxonomies, and systems. This was "IA Thinking" bubbling up.

I'd seen one of the [latest 'A Lens A Day' videos](https://youtu.be/drn-h-2pPuI "Youtube") where Andrew Hinton summed up IA Thinking...
