I'm really enjoying this series of <a href="https://atlasminor.com/notes/interstate-scenes/" title="">Interstate Scenes</a> from James A. Reeves.

He describes them as <q>A fictional collection of homeless paragraphs, remixed and upcycled bits from the past, and bloopers from the stories I’m writing.</q>

His blog, <a href="https://atlasminor.com" title="website of James A. Reeves">Atlas Minor</a>, is well worth a follow. More please.
