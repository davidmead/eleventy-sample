Last night the snow came. Boy did it come. About 20" of the white stuff got dumped on us. Dogs didn't know what to do when I let them out, so they just came straight back in.

These are the times I don't miss driving to an office.

Later in the day Josh, after clearing our drive (and a neighbours), walked our snowblower a block away to dig out an elderly couple. I did the same to for people we know across the main road.

I ache.

Writing this, drifting to some Laurie Anderson in my ears, getting the callâ€”School is cancelled tomorrow.

More snow is expected.
