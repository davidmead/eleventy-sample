In the past I've played The Division & The Division 2 on stream. Even been part of an official Ubisoft stream, which was fun.

But this year I have been making an effort to be consistent.

If you visit <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/davidmead/schedule" title="">my schedule on Twitch</a> you'll see I stream on 3 different days.

## Games

Wednesday night is <a href="https://www.thelongdark.com" title="official website">The Long Dark</a>. I'm pushing myself on the slightly harder level.

Saturday mornings are "cozy" games. More narrative focused.  I played through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663220/Coffee_Talk_Episode_2_Hibiscus__Butterfly/" title="Steam page for game">Coffee Talk 2</a> and now I'm in <a href="https://www.sigono.com/presskit-opus-echo-of-starsong" title="official site">Opus: Echo of Starsong - Full Bloom Edition</a>.

Sunday morning is <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny" title="official Bungie site">Destiny 2</a>. Fast-paced space shooter.

## Relaxing with friends
A few friends, in and out of work, have been streaming too. It's been nice just popping in-an-out of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/grueproof" title="">Chris</a>'s or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/devanmac" title="">Devon</a>'s streams. As well as seeing them in my chat.

It's all very low-stakes and chill, which is what I'm gravitating to these days.
