This was the first time I've tried making sausage gravy, though I've eaten it many times in diners.

I followed the directions from [Hillbilly Kitchen](https://youtu.be/pFoUmXnkKw8 "YouTube video")'s video. Like most "simple" dishes you can ruin it pretty easy.  - Too thin, burnt, no taste.

But this turned out pretty good. I had it with a fried slice and some of the sausage. Next time I'll cook up some <a href="/posts/2023-09-16-homemade-biscuits-and-gravy/" title="simple biscuit recipe">American biscuits</a> to have with it.
