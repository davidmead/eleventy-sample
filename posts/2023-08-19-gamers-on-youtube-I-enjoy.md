There are a handful of video games I play extensively on the Xbox.  Three I play the most are <a href="https://davidjohnmead.com/tags/thedivision2/" title="">The Division 2</a>, <a href="https://davidjohnmead.com/tags/destiny2/" title="my posts">Destiny 2</a>, and <a href="https://davidjohnmead.com/tags/thelongdark/" title="my posts">The Long Dark</a>.

Each of those have been around for over 5 years; Building, changing, and expanding.

These are the YouTube accounts I follow to keep me in-the-loop.  If you play, check them out.

## The Division 2
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NothingButSkillz" title="">NothingButSkillz</a> I've watched since playing the original Division game. Gameplay and general news</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DodRegnbue" title="">DodRegenbue</a> is fantastic for build-crafting. Going in-depth with stats & talent interactions</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hutchler" title="">Hutchler</a> is a new follow (via DodRegnbue). Speedrunner putting out some very interesting guides and history videos</li>

</ul>

Honorable mentions to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LyricalFighter" title="">Lyrical Fighter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AArtjoMM" title="">AArtjoMM</a>. I'm no PvP'er but these two are good, and make me laugh.

## Destiny 2

There is only one YouTube channel I watch for the The Long Dark and that's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Zaknafein" title="">Zaknafein</a>. Great videos showing walk-throughs, gameplay, and his take on the direction of the game.
