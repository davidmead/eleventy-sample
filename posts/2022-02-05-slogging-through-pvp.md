Before the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/WitchQueen?ciid=50638" title="">Witch Queen expansion</a> for Destiny 2 comes out, I'm trying to finish up some of the Seasonal Challenges.

One of these was 'Win 20 matches of Trails of Osiris'.

This game mode is billed as Player-versus-Player where two teams (3 players each) try to capture a Zone. Teammates have to revive you, instead of you getting back up yourself, if you're shot.

I've never played this PvP mode in Destiny before, but how long could that take?

<strong>Over an hour!</strong> That's how long.

I am not a big fan of PvP in any game, but this was grueling. I do not see how people enjoy this.

## The Meta
Every video game has a '<a href="https://ggn00b.com/for-noobs/what-does-meta-mean-in-competitive-gaming/" title="explanation on ggnoob website">meta</a>'. A build that most players adopt. With this is was all Hand Cannons and Shotguns. It felt like half the time the game was over before the zone was available to be captured.


## Twitch Stream
I decided to livestream this on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/davidmead" title="">my Twitch channel<a/>. You share my pain by watching the video below.

but don't worry, you can <a href="/video/2022-02-05-twitch-destiny2.mp4">download it</a>
and watch it with your favorite video player!

It's safe to say I will not be playing this again, even if there's a badge/challenge. Completionism be damned.
