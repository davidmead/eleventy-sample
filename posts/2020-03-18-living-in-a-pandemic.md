Since [Coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 "official WHO page") was officially declared a pandemic by World Health Organization things have been getting serious, and weird, quick.

About a week ago our local Aldi had run out of white bread, bottled water, dried pasta, toilet paper, and chicken within 2 hours of them opening. Other large chain stores closed for restocking where they'd normally be open 24 hours.

Schools shut for Spring Break early, opting for a form of remote learning for the remainder. Work from home is being trialed, or mandated, for most office workers.

Only today:
- [The border between Canada and the U.S. is closed to non-essential travel](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51949243 "BBC article")
- [Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler agree to close all US plants due to coronavirus](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/03/18/ford-gm-fca-plant-closures-coronavirus/2866944001/ "USA Today article")
- [Italy coronavirus deaths rise by record 475 in a day](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51952712 "BBC article")
- So far 8,657 people have died worldwide from reported cases

The phrases ['social distancing' and 'self-isolation'](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51506729 "title attribute") are common place.

We've stocked up on some things. Limit our exposure to others. Follow the guidlines of handwashing, etc. Check in our our family and friends through phone & video chat.

Now we wait as cases appear close to us.
