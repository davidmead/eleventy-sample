Today the moon passed between us and the sun, and we got to spectate in that most wonderful of natural phenomenonsâ€”A total eclipse.

Around 2.30pm people started gathering in their back gardens. Glasses on, we would look up and see the sun slowly being obscured.

Around 3.15pm <abbr title="Eastern Standard Time">EST</abbr> the sky darkened, the temperature dropped, both street & solar lighting turned on, and a bright silver ring hung in the air where the sun had been.

It was amazing, weird, slightly unsettling, and exhilarating.

<a href="https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68764917" title="BBC video from Ohio">Cheers, fireworks</a>, and Bonnie Tyler's "total eclipse of the heart" soon filled the quietness.

I snapped a couple of photo's on my iPhone, but not anything that conveyed what we saw with our eyes.

For a couple of seconds I turned East and everything was brightly illuminated, while behind me was still dark.

And then it was over.

Julie & I had see an eclipse in the UK before we moved to the USA, but Essex hadn't been in the path of totality.

This was special.
