I've been with <a href="https://mediatemple.net" title="">Media Temple</a> for years. Various incarnations of this blog, clients from when I did freelance web design, sites for friends & family all hosted there.

But now that the acquisition by <a href="https://www.godaddy.com" title="">GoDaddy</a> is complete I think it's time to move.

I know there's been <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/godaddy-isnt-company-think/" title="Wired article">big changes at GoDaddy</a>, but that sour taste still lingers for me, and they still have some <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/22/godaddy_managed_wordpress_ssl_keys/" title="The Register article on Hackers in GoDaddy servers">issues</a>.

Also I only have this blog to manage now so I don't need a lot.

After a quick recommendation poll on Slack I am trying <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com" title="">A2 Hosting</a>.

So things may be a little rocky while I move everything around.
