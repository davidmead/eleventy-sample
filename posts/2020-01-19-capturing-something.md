I've never been a diarist, but I keep coming back to the idea of capturing a feel of moment/day/week.

With that in mind I am going to try something. A 'retrospect' of sorts. Jot down observations at the end of the day, but not daily.

I hope this will help me get back in the habit of posting, without having drafts on specific things pile up. Which is what is happening now.
