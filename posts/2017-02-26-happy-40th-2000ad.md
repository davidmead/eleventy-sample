Growing up in England during the 70's it always seemed there were a ton of comics to read. The homegrown [Whizzer & Chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whizzer_and_Chips "Wikipedia entry"), [Dandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dandy "Wikipedia entry"), [The Beano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beano "Wikipedia entry"), etc. Also a slew of US ones from Marvel and DC. But in 1977, when I was 8, something new dropped into my local newsagents - <strong>[2000AD](http://www.2000adonline.com/ "Official site")</strong>.

This had the feel of something different. The art was more "realistic". Stories weren't the usual fare, no super heroes for one. Looking back it seemed almost subversive. It was a comic, but reading it gave me the same feeling as staying up watching TV past the [watershed](http://ask.ofcom.org.uk/help/television/watershed "OFCOM site").

I was always excited opening the pages to see what crazy new story was being introduced or which of my favorite artists were illustrating Dredd; [Dillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Dillon "Wikipedia entry")(RIP), [Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Smith_(comics) "Wikipedia entry"), [Bolland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Bolland "Wikipedia entry"). It was them who kept me drawing (I even got one published).

Every Xmas brought the guaranteed gift of the 2000AD Annual - Hardback and chock full of thrills. Every February bought the re-upping of my subscription.
I collected 2000AD for a long time, and getting to know the writers & artists made it easy to drop back into comics years later when they published things such as [V for Vendetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta "Wikipedia entry") and [Preacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preacher_(comics) "Wikipedia entry"), amongst others.

Being exposed to it from the beginning has spoiled me in a way. When I realize how vast an influence it's had on the people, stories and media that's came after. I find myself thinking, "Wasn't that a Future-Shock?", or "Bet they read Dredd as a kid too". I'm looking forward to watching the documentary [Future Shock!](https://youtu.be/4wLSHDagOcc "YouTube") that came out last year.

It's great to see it still going, thriving, and reaching a new audience.

Here's to another 40 years.
