After getting Josh's haircut, a new style of his choosing, we headed to [Sugar Bowl](https://sugarbowlwilloughby.com/ "Pho and bakery").

We both had a bowl Pho Tai. A big serving of Vietnamese noodle soup with rare steak topped with cilantro, scallion and onions. Delicious on a cold rainy day like today. Also shared an appetizer of 'Country Wings' (crispy fried with a sweet chili sauce to dip).
