Hey Terence.

I read your blog via RSS. Even linked back to a couple of your posts too over the years.

I'm a Brit living in Ohio, USA. My site uses Eleventy. I too have zero analytics on my site, so my working assumption is I have a couple people who read because they know me :-) I don't have comments on, and have yet to show webmentions.

Been blogging since the mid-2000's I think, though most of that is now in a Wordpress export that was corrupted when moving hosts. Some day I'll get around to finding a way to reinstate those posts here.
