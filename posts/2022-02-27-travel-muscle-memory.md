We fly out Thursday.  It's been years since I boarded a plane. Looking back it seemed I was doing it at least once a year.

Some old reflexive muscle memory has been kicking in this weekend:

<ul>
<li>Music downloaded to the phone</li>
<li>Podcasts downloaded to the phone too</li>
<li>Books downloaded to Kindle</li>
<li>Making sure I have at least 2 charging cords (new ones since swapping to an iPhone)</li>
<li>Slip-on shoes to wear at the airport, with boots packed in the checked luggage</li>
<li>Dopp kit re-supplied</li>
<li>Medication portioned out</li>
</ul>

But now with the pandemic we have to navigate new documentation, masks, and COVID-19 tests.

I am <strong>dreading</strong> this trip.
