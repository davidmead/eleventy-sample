We got the sad news last night.

After a long struggle with various health issues, compounded by cancer, Julie's dad died last night.

He served as a Marine in the Vietnam War. Worked as a telephone engineer for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System" title="Wikipedia entry for Bell Telephone Company">Ma Bell</a>", AT&T, and later as an independent contractor.

I always felt welcomed and supported by Jim. He helped financially when we moved over by co-signing, led me through the radically different taxes system, helped with practical home repairs, and what little I know of US sports is pretty much thanks to him.

He was always curious. Asking questions about a multitude of topics. But we could also just sit and watch a crazy 80's action film.

He was a big part of my life.  He was my second father. We will all miss him.
