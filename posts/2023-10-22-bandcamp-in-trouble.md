<a href="https://bandcamp.com" title="">Bandcamp</a>, for years now, has been my <a href="/tags/bandcamp/" title="all my posts tagged Bandcamp">primary source</a> for purchasing new music.

I love the wide choice of genres from both new & established artists. Those artists may email you direct, <em>which is cool</em>. And <a href="https://isitbandcampfriday.com" title="">Bandcamp Friday</a><sup><a href="#footnote1" title="footnote">1</a></sup> is a thing. Also they <a href="https://www.bandcampunited.org" title="official union site">unionized</a>.

But over the last week there's been troubling news around Bandcamp.

## Bad news Bandcamp

Along with the recent layoffs, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/28/epic-games-is-eliminating-16percent-of-its-workforce-and-selling-bandcamp.html" title="CNBC article">Epic sold off Bandcamp</a> (I had forgotten they bought them) after only a year or so of ownership.

Acquired by <a href="https://www.songtradr.com" title="">Songtradr</a> (whom I'd never heard off), a music licensing platform, who stated they <q cite="https://www.songtradr.com/blog/posts/songtradr-bandcamp-acquisition">will continue to operate Bandcamp as a marketplace and music community with an artist-first revenue share</q>.

During the acquisition Bandcamp's union were in the midst of negotiations with Epic. There was <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/songtradr-recognize-bandcamp-united?source=direct_link&" title="">a petition</a> (which I signed) for Songtradr to meet with the union too.

Then on October 17th, <a href="https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2023/10/every-member-of-bandcamp-united-union-bargaining-team-was-laid-off.html" title="Hypebot article">Songtradr essentially laid off 50% of Bandcamp's staff</a>, which included <strong>all the unionâ€™s eight-person bargaining team</strong>.

## What next?

Im worried that Songtradr will shoe-horn Bandcamp into their licensing platform, making artists jump ship, and closing the shop.

Also, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/bandcamp-bargaining-union-layoffs-songtradr-18432047.php" title="SF Gate article">with 70% of the vinyl team gone, and the editorial cut by two-thirds</a>, some of what Bandcamp so special has already left.

Fingers-crossed that those remaining can make it work, and Bandcamp Friday will continue.
