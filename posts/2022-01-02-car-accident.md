On Monday 27<sup>th</sup> I get one of those calls a parent <strong>never</strong> wants. Josh's emotional voice telling me he'd been in an accident.

Driving in the dark his tires hit slush/ice and sent his car into a guard rail, then a ditchâ€”Thankfully he was ok, albeit shaken up.

The car? Not so much.

I went to pick him up from a church parking lot, then returned with Julie to retrieve the car.

After filling it up with gas (a separate conversation we had with him) I drove it to the auto body shop.

We just heard from the insurance that it's being written off. So now we have to start looking for a "new" second-hand car.
