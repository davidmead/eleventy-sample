I've decided to delete my accounts on Twitter and Instagram.

These two services has become less important <em>for me</em> over the years. Features I don't find useful or engaging, increased advertising , willful avoidance on topics like bullying or hate-speech. These have all pushed me further away.

But why close them completely? Simple. I don't see what I liked ever coming back.

This a knock-on of being an "early adopter" I guess. Witnessing the changes of how you are no longer the target audience. Add to that the self-realization that it is okay to leave things behind.
