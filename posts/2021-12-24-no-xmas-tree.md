The night of Christmas Eve. Sitting here with a bottle of [Winter Welcome Ale](https://www.samuelsmithsbrewery.co.uk/shop/bottles/ale/winter-welcome-ale/ "Samuel Smith's British beer"), dog by my feet. Julie & Josh are out looking at the decorations—But it feels different from years past.

For one thing, it's 54℉. Not a speck of snow anywhere. I lost count who may/may not have the [Omicron variant of COVID](https://news.yahoo.com/omicron-cases-explode-ohio-see-154701828.html "Omicron Cases Explode In Ohio - Yahoo news") days ago. Us included.  Though we are  all fully vaccinated, Josh is suffering from some strain of cold virus. I also didn't buy a tree this year.

Time's flown by. Before I knew it we only had a few days left and it didn't seem that important.  Don't get me wrong. We have some decorations out. I'll be cooking a Xmas dinner for us, and we'll be opening presents. But no tree.

Last year, amidst the Pandemic, the tree [was up in November](/posts/2020-11-29-egg-nog-xmas-tree/ "Toasting the tree with egg nog"). Last year felt more, important, to do that.

Maybe 2022 will be different.

But hey, at least [the wolves are back in Switzerland](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59738541 "story from the BBC") and there's now [a TV you can taste](https://futurism.com/the-byte/screen-flavors-lick "article on Futrism.com"). Merry Christmas.
